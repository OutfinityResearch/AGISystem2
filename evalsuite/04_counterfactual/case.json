    "natural_language": "In normal physics, water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level pressure. Humans need liquid water to survive. At temperatures above the boiling point, water becomes steam. At temperatures below the freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius, water becomes ice. The average room temperature is about 20 degrees Celsius. The human body temperature is approximately 37 degrees Celsius. Water at body temperature is still liquid because 37 is less than 100.",
