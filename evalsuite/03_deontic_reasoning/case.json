    "natural_language": "In our city, there are strict rules about drone flights. Drones are prohibited from flying over hospitals for safety reasons. Drones are also prohibited from flying over schools during school hours. However, medical delivery drones have special permissions - they are allowed to fly over hospitals when delivering medical supplies. Police drones are permitted to fly anywhere during emergencies. Regular commercial drones can only fly in designated drone zones. Flying over private property without permission is prohibited for all drones. The city center is a no-fly zone for all drones except emergency services.",
