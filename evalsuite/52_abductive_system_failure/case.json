    "natural_language": "In IT systems, server crashes can be caused by memory leaks, disk full, or hardware failure. Memory leaks are caused by bad code or resource exhaustion. Disk full is caused by log accumulation or data growth. Hardware failure is caused by overheating or component wear. Overheating is caused by fan failure or poor ventilation. Network timeouts can be caused by high load or network congestion. Database errors are caused by connection pool exhaustion or query timeout. The production server crashed and showed high memory usage before the crash.",
