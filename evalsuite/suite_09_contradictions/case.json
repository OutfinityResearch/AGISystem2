A doctor can have between 1 and 50 patients. Disjoint categories: A person cannot be both alive and dead. A diagnosis cannot be both confirmed and ruled_out. An employee cannot be both active and terminated. Current facts: Patient John was born in Chicago. John's biological mother is Mary. John's biological father is Robert. John is alive. John has DrSmith as doctor. John has DrJones as doctor. DrSmith is a cardiologist. DrJones is a neurologist. John's diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.",
