Smoking causes coughing. Dehydration causes headaches. Stress causes headaches. High blood pressure causes headaches. When someone has fever AND coughing together, respiratory infection is most likely. When someone has fever, coughing AND fatigue, influenza is likely. Food poisoning causes stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. In physics: Heat causes expansion. Friction causes heat. Electricity causes magnetism. Magnetism can cause electricity. In environment: Pollution causes health problems. Deforestation causes climate change. Climate change causes extreme weather. Patient John has fever and coughing. Patient Mary has stomach pain and nausea.",
