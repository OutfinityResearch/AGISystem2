    "natural_language": "Company hiring policy: Candidates are evaluated on skills, experience, and certifications. The required certification for the role is PMP. Candidate Alice has 5 years experience and PMP certification. Candidate Bob has 8 years experience but no PMP. Candidate Carol has 3 years and PMP certification. Gender, age, and ethnicity must not affect decisions. Pay equity policy: All level 2 engineers receive the same pay band regardless of demographics. Performance is measured by completed projects and peer reviews. Employee Dan is level 2 with good performance. Employee Eve is level 2 with good performance. Their genders are different but pay should be equal. Content moderation: Political sentiment should not affect factual evaluation. The city council approved the budget on Monday - this is factual regardless of political framing. Toxic language should be separated from factual claims. The statement 'Team Delta deployed v2 yesterday' is factual regardless of emotional language around it.",
