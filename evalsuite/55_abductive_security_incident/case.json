    "natural_language": "In cybersecurity, data breaches can be caused by phishing attacks, unpatched vulnerabilities, or insider threats. Phishing attacks are caused by social engineering or fake emails. Unpatched vulnerabilities are caused by delayed updates or legacy systems. Insider threats are caused by disgruntled employees or negligence. Malware infections are caused by drive-by downloads, infected attachments, or USB devices. Unauthorized access is caused by stolen credentials, brute force attacks, or session hijacking. The company network showed data exfiltration and suspicious login patterns from an internal IP address.",
