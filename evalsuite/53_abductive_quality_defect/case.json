    "natural_language": "In manufacturing, surface defects can be caused by contamination, tool wear, or incorrect settings. Contamination is caused by dirty environment or improper handling. Tool wear is caused by excessive use or poor maintenance. Incorrect settings are caused by operator error or calibration drift. Dimensional errors are caused by thermal expansion, tool deflection, or programming errors. Assembly defects are caused by missing parts, incorrect torque, or misalignment. A batch of parts showed surface defects and the tools had been used for 500 hours without maintenance.",
