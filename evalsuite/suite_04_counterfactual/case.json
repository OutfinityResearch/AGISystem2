Humans need water to survive. Fire requires oxygen to burn. Gravity pulls objects down. Metal expands when heated. Temporal facts: World War 1 happened before World War 2. The Renaissance came before the Industrial Revolution. The Internet was invented after television. Smartphones came after personal computers. Process sequences: Design comes before manufacturing. Testing comes after development. Planning is required before execution. Approval is needed before implementation.",
