    "natural_language": "In fire investigation, smoke indicates fire. Fire requires fuel, heat, and oxygen. Electrical shorts can cause fires. Arson involves intentional fire setting. Faulty wiring causes electrical shorts. Overloaded circuits cause electrical shorts. Lightning strikes can start fires. Grease buildup causes kitchen fires. Unattended cooking causes kitchen fires. Cigarettes can cause fires when dropped. Fire causes smoke. Fire causes heat damage. Fire causes ash residue. The warehouse had smoke and heat damage.",
