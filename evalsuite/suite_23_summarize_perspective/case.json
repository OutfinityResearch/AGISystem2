Planting trees reduces carbon emissions. Economic perspective: Renewable energy creates jobs. Carbon tax affects businesses. Climate adaptation costs money. Green technology is an investment. Social perspective: Climate change affects health. Heat waves cause deaths. Air pollution causes respiratory disease. Climate refugees are increasing. Environmental perspective: Biodiversity loss accelerates. Coral reefs are dying. Species extinction increases. Ecosystems are disrupted.",
