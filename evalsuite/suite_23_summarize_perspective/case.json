  "description": "Tests ability to gather and structure knowledge for a multi-section policy report on climate change. Simulates essay writing where the system must: 1) Identify the causal chain, 2) Extract economic implications, 3) Find solutions, 4) Assess social impacts, 5) Draw conclusions from the evidence.",

    "natural_language": "SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE: Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap heat. Trapped heat causes temperature rise. Temperature rise causes ice cap melting. Ice cap melting causes sea level rise. Sea level rise threatens coastal cities. Methane is a greenhouse gas. Deforestation releases carbon dioxide. Fossil fuel burning releases carbon dioxide. ECONOMIC FACTORS: Carbon tax reduces emissions. Carbon tax costs businesses money. Renewable energy creates jobs. Renewable energy requires initial investment. Green technology attracts venture capital. Climate adaptation costs governments billions. Energy efficiency saves money long-term. SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE: Solar power generates clean electricity. Wind power generates clean electricity. Electric vehicles reduce emissions. Public transit reduces emissions. Reforestation absorbs carbon dioxide. Carbon capture technology is emerging. Nuclear power is low carbon. SOCIAL IMPACTS: Heat waves cause deaths. Air pollution causes respiratory illness. Climate refugees are increasing globally. Food prices rise due to droughts. Water scarcity affects agriculture. Extreme weather destroys infrastructure. POLICY RESPONSES: Paris Agreement sets emission targets. Carbon markets enable trading. Building codes improve efficiency. Vehicle standards reduce pollution. Subsidies encourage renewables. Research funding advances technology.",
