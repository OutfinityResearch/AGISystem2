    "natural_language": "In economics, inflation can be caused by money supply growth, demand increase, or supply chain disruption. High unemployment is caused by recession, automation, or structural changes. GDP growth is caused by increased spending, investment growth, or export growth. Currency depreciation is caused by inflation, trade deficit, or interest rate cuts. Stock market decline is caused by earnings miss, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical risk. The economy showed inflation increase and currency depreciation simultaneously.",
