# Suite 34: Provenance (URC)

Purpose:
- Validate that `Session.executeNL()` records provenance entries.
- Validate that optional materialization produces derived DSL lines only (audit), without injecting provenance into the KB truth store.

Notes:
- This suite is intentionally minimal and focuses on auditability invariants.
