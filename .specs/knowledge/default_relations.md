# Default Relation Set (Data Spec)

Purpose: provide a canonical set of relation types inspired by OWL-style ontologies, with geometric semantics and permutation characteristics. These defaults are loaded at bootstrap and registered in `RelationPermuter`; new relations can be added via config, but defaults stay stable across profiles.

## Relation Entries
For each relation define: `name`, `inverse`, `characteristics` (transitive, symmetric, functional), `permutation` (same vs. distinct forward/inverse), `domain/range` hints (ontology dims), and `usage` (geometric intent).

- `IS_A` (subClassOf)
  - Inverse: none (parent only)
  - Characteristics: transitive
  - Permutation: forward only
  - Usage: class hierarchy inclusion; strengthens ontology dims.
- `EQUIVALENT_TO`
  - Inverse: self (symmetric)
  - Characteristics: symmetric
  - Permutation: same forward/inverse
  - Usage: merge concept manifolds; collapse distance.
- `DISJOINT_WITH`
  - Inverse: self (symmetric)
  - Characteristics: symmetric
  - Permutation: same forward/inverse
  - Usage: mark empty intersections; used by validation.
- `PART_OF`
  - Inverse: `HAS_PART`
  - Characteristics: transitive
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: compositional structure; containment.
- `HAS_PART`
  - Inverse: `PART_OF`
  - Characteristics: transitive
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: compositional structure; ownership of components.
- `HAS_PROPERTY`
  - Inverse: `PROPERTY_OF`
  - Characteristics: functional (one property instance -> many hosts)
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: attach attributes; tighten relevant dims.
- `PROPERTY_OF`
  - Inverse: `HAS_PROPERTY`
  - Characteristics: inverse-functional
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: attribute lookup.
- `LOCATED_IN`
  - Inverse: `CONTAINS`
  - Characteristics: non-symmetric, non-transitive by default (overrideable)
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: spatial or contextual location.
- `CONTAINS`
  - Inverse: `LOCATED_IN`
  - Characteristics: non-symmetric, non-transitive by default
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: spatial/container relationships.
- `BEFORE`
  - Inverse: `AFTER`
  - Characteristics: transitive
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse; often paired with temporal rotation
  - Usage: temporal ordering.
- `AFTER`
  - Inverse: `BEFORE`
  - Characteristics: transitive
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: temporal ordering.
- `CAUSES`
  - Inverse: `CAUSED_BY`
  - Characteristics: non-symmetric
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: causal reasoning; abductive inverse probing.
- `CAUSED_BY`
  - Inverse: `CAUSES`
  - Characteristics: non-symmetric
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: causal backtracking.
- `AGENT_OF`
  - Inverse: `HAS_AGENT`
  - Characteristics: non-symmetric
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: role binding (subject/agent).
- `HAS_AGENT`
  - Inverse: `AGENT_OF`
  - Characteristics: non-symmetric
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: role binding.
- `PATIENT_OF`
  - Inverse: `HAS_PATIENT`
  - Characteristics: non-symmetric
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: role binding (object/patient).
- `HAS_PATIENT`
  - Inverse: `PATIENT_OF`
  - Characteristics: non-symmetric
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: role binding.
- `PERMITS`
  - Inverse: `PERMITTED_BY` (optional)
  - Characteristics: non-symmetric; axiology-heavy
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: deontic reasoning (positive axiology dims).
- `OBLIGATES`
  - Inverse: `OBLIGATED_BY` (optional)
  - Characteristics: non-symmetric; axiology-heavy
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: deontic reasoning with tight radii.
- `PROHIBITS`
  - Inverse: `PROHIBITED_BY` (optional)
  - Characteristics: non-symmetric; axiology-heavy
  - Permutation: distinct forward/inverse
  - Usage: deontic reasoning (negative axiology dims).
- `RELATED_TO` (fallback)
  - Inverse: self (symmetric)
  - Characteristics: symmetric; low weight
  - Permutation: same forward/inverse
  - Usage: generic association when no specific relation fits.

## Domain/Range Hints
- OWL-style guidance: `IS_A`, `PART_OF`, `HAS_PART`, `EQUIVALENT_TO`, `DISJOINT_WITH` expect ontology-heavy dims.
- Deontic relations (`PERMITS/OBLIGATES/PROHIBITS`) emphasize axiology dims (256–383).
- Temporal (`BEFORE/AFTER`) can combine with `TemporalMemory` rotation; store permutation separately from rotation.
- Causal (`CAUSES/CAUSED_BY`) may activate empirical dims and causal-specific subspace if defined.

## Registration and Seeds
- At bootstrap, defaults register in `RelationPermuter` with names above; inverses use distinct permutations except symmetric relations (reuse).
- Seeds come from `Config.relationSeed`; deterministic across runs.
- New relations can be appended via config without altering defaults; avoid mutating or renaming defaults to preserve reproducibility.

## Test Usage
- Auto/manual tests should cover:
  - Transitivity (`IS_A`, `PART_OF`, `BEFORE`).
  - Symmetry (`EQUIVALENT_TO`, `DISJOINT_WITH`, `RELATED_TO`).
  - Deontic overrides (`PERMITS/PROHIBITS` with axiology dims).
  - Causal abductive probing (`CAUSES/CAUSED_BY`).
  - Role binding (`AGENT_OF`, `PATIENT_OF`).
