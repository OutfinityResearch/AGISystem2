LAW THEORY - HUMAN-READABLE DESCRIPTION

=== LEGAL SYSTEMS ===

Common Law System:
A legal system based on judicial precedent where courts create binding authority through case-based reasoning. Lower courts must follow the decisions of higher courts in their jurisdiction, establishing the doctrine of stare decisis (let the decision stand).

Civil Law System:
A legal system based on comprehensive legal codes enacted by the legislature. Judges interpret and apply statutory provisions rather than creating law through precedent. The legislature holds supreme authority to create law, though judicial review may limit this power.

Religious Law System:
A legal system derived from religious texts and divine sources. Religious scholars and councils interpret sacred texts to establish interpretative authority. Religious courts enforce these interpretations in jurisdictions that recognize religious law.

Mixed Legal System:
A jurisdiction that incorporates elements from multiple legal traditions, such as common law, civil law, and customary law. This legal pluralism allows different legal systems to coexist and apply to different areas of law or different communities.

Constitutional Supremacy:
The principle that the constitution is the supreme law of the land. Any statute or government action that contradicts the constitution is invalid. Courts exercise judicial review to determine whether laws comply with constitutional provisions.

=== CONTRACT LAW - FORMATION ===

Contract Formation:
A valid contract requires three elements: offer, acceptance, and consideration. When one party makes an offer, another party accepts it, and both parties provide consideration (something of value), a legally binding contract is formed.

Valid Offer:
An offer must contain definite terms, demonstrate the offeror's intention to be bound, and be communicated to the offeree. A valid offer is capable of being accepted to form a binding contract.

Mirror Image Rule:
Under common law, an acceptance must exactly mirror the terms of the offer. Any change to the offer's terms constitutes a counteroffer rather than an acceptance, rejecting the original offer.

Mailbox Rule:
Under the mailbox rule, acceptance becomes effective upon dispatch when properly mailed. The contract is formed when the offeree sends the acceptance, not when the offeror receives it.

Consideration Requirement:
Consideration is a bargained-for exchange of legal value between parties. Both parties must provide something of value with mutual obligations for the contract to be enforceable.

Past Consideration:
An act performed before a promise is made does not constitute valid consideration. Past acts lack the bargained-for exchange necessary for enforceable contracts.

Promissory Estoppel:
When a promisor makes a promise that the promisee reasonably relies upon to their detriment, the court may enforce the promise to prevent injustice, even without consideration.

Illusory Promise:
A promise that gives the promisor unlimited discretion to perform appears to be a commitment but creates no real obligation. Illusory promises lack valid consideration and are unenforceable.

Option Contract:
When an offeree pays consideration to keep an offer open for a specified time, the offeror's promise becomes irrevocable. This creates a binding option contract.

Firm Offer (UCC):
Under UCC 2-205, a merchant's written assurance to keep an offer open for goods is irrevocable without consideration, up to three months. This provides protection for merchants dealing in goods.

=== CONTRACT LAW - VALIDITY AND DEFENSES ===

Mutual Mistake:
When both parties share a misconception about a material fact that forms the basis of the contract, the contract may be voidable. Courts may grant rescission to restore parties to their pre-contract position.

Unilateral Mistake:
When one party makes a mistake and the other party knows of the mistake, making enforcement unconscionable, the mistaken party may seek rescission.

Fraudulent Misrepresentation:
When a party makes a false statement about a material fact with intent to deceive, and the other party reasonably relies on it, the contract is voidable. The deceived party may seek rescission and damages.

Innocent Misrepresentation:
A false statement about a material fact made without fraudulent intent may still allow rescission if the other party relied on it. However, damages for fraud are not available.

Duress:
When a party makes an improper threat leaving the other party no reasonable alternative, any consent given is involuntary. Contracts formed under duress are voidable.

Undue Influence:
When a party in a dominant position exercises unfair persuasion over a susceptible person, the resulting contract may be voidable by the weaker party.

Unconscionability:
A contract with both procedural defects (unfair bargaining process) and substantive unfairness (grossly one-sided terms) may be found unconscionable. Courts may refuse to enforce unconscionable contracts.

Capacity - Minors:
Persons under the age of majority lack capacity to form binding contracts. Minors may disaffirm contracts, except for contracts for necessaries (food, clothing, shelter).

Capacity - Mental Incompetence:
A person who lacks mental capacity to understand the nature of a transaction may have contracts deemed void or voidable. Adjudicated incompetents' contracts are void.

Capacity - Intoxication:
Voluntary intoxication may render a contract voidable if the intoxicated party cannot understand the transaction and the other party knows of the intoxication.

=== CONTRACT LAW - STATUTE OF FRAUDS ===

Statute of Frauds:
Certain types of contracts must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged for them to be enforceable. This requirement prevents fraud and ensures reliability of important agreements.

SOF - Land Sale:
Contracts for the sale of real property must be in writing with essential terms to be enforceable under the statute of frauds.

SOF - One Year:
Contracts that cannot possibly be performed within one year from formation must be in writing to be enforceable.

SOF - Sale of Goods:
Under UCC 2-201, contracts for the sale of goods priced at $500 or more must be in writing to be enforceable.

SOF - Merchants Confirmation:
Between merchants, a written confirmation sent by one party satisfies the statute of frauds if the receiving party fails to object within ten days.

Part Performance Exception:
In land sale contracts, part performance (taking possession, making improvements, paying purchase price) may take the contract out of the statute of frauds, making it enforceable without a writing.

=== CONTRACT INTERPRETATION ===

Plain Meaning Rule:
When contract language is unambiguous, courts apply the ordinary meaning of the words without admitting extrinsic evidence. This promotes textual certainty.

Ambiguity Construction:
When contract terms are ambiguous, courts admit extrinsic evidence to determine party intent. Ambiguous terms are construed against the drafter.

Parol Evidence Rule:
When parties create an integrated written contract with a merger clause, prior negotiations and contemporaneous oral agreements are excluded from evidence.

Parol Evidence Exception:
The parol evidence rule does not bar extrinsic evidence offered to prove fraud, mistake, or other defenses to contract formation.

Course of Performance:
When parties repeatedly perform under a contract in a specific way without objection, that pattern informs the interpretation of contract terms.

Course of Dealing:
Prior transactions between the same parties establish patterns that inform the interpretation of their current contract.

Trade Usage:
Industry customs and practices are implied into contracts when parties have reasonable expectations based on those customs.

=== CONTRACT PERFORMANCE AND BREACH ===

Material Breach:
A significant failure to perform that goes to the essence of the contract discharges the other party's performance obligation and allows an immediate suit for damages.

Minor Breach:
An insubstantial failure to perform does not discharge the other party's duty. The non-breaching party must continue performing but may recover damages.

Anticipatory Repudiation:
When a party unequivocally refuses to perform before performance is due, this constitutes an immediate breach. The other party may suspend performance and sue immediately.

Adequate Assurance:
When a party has reasonable concerns about the other's ability to perform, they may request adequate assurance. Failure to provide assurance may be treated as anticipatory repudiation under UCC 2-609.

Substantial Performance:
When a party essentially completes performance with only minor deviations, they may recover payment minus damages for the deviations. This doctrine balances fairness against the forfeiture that would result from denying all payment.

Perfect Tender Rule:
Under the UCC, goods sold must exactly conform to contract specifications. Any deviation allows the buyer to reject the goods.

Cure Right:
When a seller delivers nonconforming goods and time remains under the contract, the seller may cure by delivering conforming goods after prompt notice.

Installment Contract:
In contracts with multiple deliveries, a buyer may only reject an installment if it substantially impairs the value of the whole contract.

=== CONTRACT CONDITIONS ===

Condition Precedent:
An event that must occur before a party's performance becomes due. If the condition does not occur, there is no obligation to perform.

Condition Subsequent:
An event that, when it occurs, discharges an existing obligation. The duty ends when the condition subsequent is fulfilled.

Express Condition:
Conditions explicitly stated in the contract require strict compliance. Substantial performance does not satisfy express conditions.

Constructive Condition:
Conditions implied by law to ensure fair ordering of performance. Courts impose these conditions to promote justice.

Concurrent Conditions:
When parties must perform simultaneously, both must tender performance. Neither is in breach if both are ready to perform.

Satisfaction Clause:
When a contract requires personal satisfaction, honest dissatisfaction is sufficient to avoid the obligation. A subjective standard applies when the contract involves personal taste.

Excuse of Condition:
A condition may be excused by waiver, hindrance by the party who would benefit, or to prevent disproportionate forfeiture.

=== CONTRACT REMEDIES - DAMAGES ===

Expectation Damages:
The non-breaching party is entitled to the benefit of their bargain, receiving damages that put them in the position they would have been in if the contract had been performed.

Compensatory Damages:
Actual losses that were foreseeable at contract formation and proven with reasonable certainty are recoverable as money damages.

Consequential Damages:
Indirect losses and special damages are recoverable if they were foreseeable to the breaching party at the time of contract formation.

Hadley Rule:
Damages are limited to those arising naturally from the breach or from special circumstances the breaching party knew about at contract formation.

Mitigation Duty:
The non-breaching party must make reasonable efforts to minimize losses. Avoidable losses are not recoverable.

Reliance Damages:
An alternative measure that restores the injured party to their pre-contract position by compensating reliance expenses.

Restitution Damages:
When one party is unjustly enriched, the value conferred must be returned through restitutionary recovery, often in quasi-contract.

Liquidated Damages:
Pre-estimated damages agreed upon at contract formation are enforceable if reasonable and not a penalty. This provides certainty when actual damages are difficult to prove.

Penalty Clause:
Stipulated damages that are excessive and serve to punish rather than compensate are unenforceable as penalty clauses.

Nominal Damages:
When a technical breach causes no actual loss, courts award a token amount to vindicate the legal right violated.

Punitive Damages:
Damages to punish and deter are rare in contract law but may be available when the breach involves tortious conduct.

=== CONTRACT REMEDIES - EQUITABLE ===

Specific Performance:
When goods are unique (especially real property) and money damages are inadequate, courts may order the breaching party to perform the contract.

Injunction:
When a contract contains a negative covenant, courts may enjoin the party from performing the prohibited act.

Rescission:
A voidable contract may be canceled, with both parties restored to the status quo ante (the position before the contract).

Reformation:
When a writing contains a scrivener's error that differs from the parties' true agreement, courts may rewrite the contract to reflect the actual agreement.

Declaratory Judgment:
When contract rights are uncertain, a party may seek judicial determination of rights and obligations without requesting money damages.

=== THIRD PARTY RIGHTS ===

Third Party Beneficiary:
When parties intend to benefit a third party, that intended beneficiary has contract rights and can sue to enforce the contract.

Creditor Beneficiary:
When a promisee owes a pre-existing debt to a third party and the promisor promises to pay that debt, the creditor third party may enforce the promise.

Donee Beneficiary:
When a promisee intends to make a gift to a third party through a contract, the donee may enforce the contract.

Incidental Beneficiary:
A third party who unintentionally benefits from a contract has no rights to enforce it and lacks standing to sue.

Assignment:
Contract rights may be transferred from the assignor to the assignee. After notification, the obligor must perform for the assignee.

Delegation:
Contract duties may be delegated to a delegatee, but the delegator remains liable. Personal service contracts require obligee consent for delegation.

Anti-Assignment Clause:
A clause prohibiting assignment may be breached but generally does not void the transfer. The obligor's remedy is limited to damages.

=== DISCHARGE AND EXCUSE ===

Impossibility:
Objective impossibility caused by an unforeseeable event without party fault discharges performance obligations.

Impracticability:
Under the UCC, extreme and unreasonable cost increases from unforeseeable circumstances that contradict basic assumptions may excuse performance.

Frustration of Purpose:
When an unforeseeable event destroys the principal purpose of the contract, eliminating its value, performance may be excused.

Mutual Rescission:
Parties may agree to cancel the contract by mutual consent. This agreement to cancel is itself a new contract that discharges obligations.

Accord and Satisfaction:
When parties dispute a claim and reach an agreement to settle, performance of the accord satisfies and discharges the original claim.

Novation:
Introduction of a new party to substitute for an original party, with all parties intending to discharge the original party's obligations.

Modification:
Parties may change contract terms by mutual consent. Common law requires new consideration, but the UCC does not.

Waiver:
Voluntary relinquishment of a known right with intentional abandonment constitutes waiver, requiring no consideration.

=== COURT SYSTEMS AND JURISDICTION ===

Court Hierarchy:
Judicial systems have multiple levels: trial courts (first level), appellate courts (middle level), and supreme courts (top level). Higher courts' precedents bind lower courts.

Subject Matter Jurisdiction:
Courts must have constitutional or statutory power over the type of case presented. This jurisdiction cannot be waived or conferred by consent.

Personal Jurisdiction:
Courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants who have minimum contacts with the forum state, satisfying due process requirements of fair play.

Diversity Jurisdiction:
Federal courts have jurisdiction when parties are from different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

Federal Question:
Federal courts have jurisdiction when a claim arises under federal law, as stated in a well-pleaded complaint.

Venue:
Proper venue considers geographical convenience and is typically the judicial district where the defendant resides or where the claim arose.

Standing:
Plaintiffs must have injury in fact caused by the defendant that is redressable by the court to have constitutional standing.

Justiciability:
Cases must present actual controversies that are ripe (ready for resolution) and not moot (no longer presenting a live dispute).

Appellate Review:
Appellate courts review final judgments from trial courts, applying de novo review to legal questions and clear error review to factual findings.

Writ of Certiorari:
The Supreme Court exercises discretionary review, granting certiorari when four justices vote to hear a case.

=== CIVIL PROCEDURE ===

Burden of Proof:
In civil cases, plaintiffs carry the burden of proving each element by a preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not).

Summary Judgment:
When there is no genuine issue of material fact, courts grant judgment as a matter of law, viewing evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.

Motion to Dismiss:
Under Rule 12(b)(6), courts dismiss complaints that fail to state a legal claim, accepting all allegations as true.

Discovery:
Parties may seek relevant, non-privileged information with broad scope, subject to proportionality requirements.

Attorney-Client Privilege:
Confidential communications between client and attorney seeking legal advice are protected from disclosure.

Work Product Doctrine:
Materials prepared in anticipation of litigation, especially containing mental impressions, receive qualified protection from discovery.

Class Action:
When class members are numerous and share common questions with a typical representative providing adequate representation, courts may certify a class action under Rule 23.

Res Judicata:
A final judgment on the merits between the same parties on the same claim precludes relitigation (claim preclusion).

Collateral Estoppel:
When an issue was actually litigated and necessary to a final judgment, it cannot be relitigated (issue preclusion).

Default Judgment:
When a defendant fails to respond after proper service, the court may enter judgment by default.

=== CRIMINAL LAW - ELEMENTS ===

Criminal Actus Reus:
A voluntary act or omission of a legal duty that causes prohibited harm constitutes the physical element of a crime.

Criminal Mens Rea:
A culpable mental state (purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently) constitutes the mental element of a crime.

Strict Liability Crime:
Certain public welfare offenses require no mens rea. Defendants are liable without proof of intent.

Causation - But For:
The prosecution must prove actual causation: but for the defendant's act, the harm would not have occurred (factual causation).

Proximate Cause:
Legal causation requires foreseeability. Intervening causes may break the chain of proximate causation.

=== CRIMINAL LAW - SPECIFIC CRIMES ===

Murder:
The unlawful killing of a human with malice aforethought constitutes murder.

Felony Murder:
When death occurs during the commission of a dangerous felony, the defendant is liable for murder without proof of malice.

Manslaughter:
Unlawful killing without malice, such as in the heat of passion from adequate provocation, constitutes voluntary manslaughter.

Larceny:
Taking and carrying away another's personal property with intent to permanently deprive the owner constitutes larceny.

Robbery:
Larceny accomplished by force or intimidation from the person or presence of the victim constitutes robbery.

Burglary:
At common law, breaking and entering the dwelling of another at nighttime with intent to commit a felony constitutes burglary.

Assault:
An attempt to commit battery with apparent ability or creating reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful contact constitutes assault.

Battery:
Unlawful application of force to another person, resulting in harmful or offensive contact, constitutes battery.

Rape:
Sexual intercourse without consent, obtained by force, threat, or when the victim lacks capacity to consent, constitutes rape.

Kidnapping:
Unlawful confinement and movement of a victim with asportation (carrying away) constitutes kidnapping.

Arson:
Malicious burning of another's dwelling constitutes arson at common law.

=== CRIMINAL LAW - DEFENSES ===

Self-Defense:
Reasonable belief of an unlawful attack justifies the use of proportional force against imminent harm.

Defense of Others:
Reasonable belief that a third party faces unlawful attack justifies the use of necessary force to protect them.

Insanity Defense:
Under M'Naghten, a mental disease preventing the defendant from knowing right from wrong provides an insanity defense.

Diminished Capacity:
A mental condition that negates the required mens rea may provide a partial defense, reducing the charge level.

Intoxication Defense:
Voluntary intoxication may negate the specific intent required for certain crimes.

Duress:
Threat of imminent death or harm with no reasonable alternative excuses criminal conduct (except murder).

Necessity:
Choosing the lesser evil to avoid greater imminent harm with no legal alternative justifies criminal conduct.

Entrapment:
Government inducement of a crime by someone lacking predisposition to commit it provides an entrapment defense.

Mistake of Fact:
An honest and reasonable mistake of fact that negates mens rea may provide a defense.

Mistake of Law:
Ignorance of the law is generally not an excuse, with rare exceptions for reasonable reliance on official misstatements.

=== CRIMINAL PROCEDURE - CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ===

Double Jeopardy:
The Fifth Amendment prohibits multiple prosecutions for the same offense once jeopardy attaches.

Speedy Trial:
Unreasonable delay causing prejudice to the defendant violates the Sixth Amendment right to speedy trial.

Confrontation Clause:
The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses who testify under oath.

=== EVIDENCE LAW ===

Relevance:
Evidence with a tendency to prove a material fact that makes it more or less probable is relevant and admissible.

Prejudice Exclusion:
Under FRE 403, relevant evidence may be excluded if unfair prejudice substantially outweighs probative value.
