============================================================================
ANATOMY AND ORGAN SYSTEMS
============================================================================

The human body consists of multiple interconnected organ systems that work together to maintain life and homeostasis.

The CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM includes the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The heart pumps blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues while removing waste products. The circulatory system is essential for sustaining all bodily functions.

The RESPIRATORY SYSTEM consists of the lungs and airways. The lungs facilitate gas exchange, bringing oxygen into the bloodstream and removing carbon dioxide. This process is vital for cellular metabolism and life itself.

The NERVOUS SYSTEM comprises the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. The brain controls all bodily functions through electrical and chemical signals transmitted via the nervous system. This system regulates everything from voluntary movements to automatic processes like breathing.

The DIGESTIVE SYSTEM includes organs like the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas. These organs break down food into nutrients that can be absorbed and used by the body. Digestive enzymes facilitate this breakdown process.

The URINARY SYSTEM consists of the kidneys, bladder, and associated structures. The kidneys filter blood to remove waste products and excess substances, producing urine. This system maintains fluid balance and electrolyte homeostasis.

The ENDOCRINE SYSTEM comprises glands that produce hormones. These chemical messengers regulate metabolism, growth, reproduction, and many other bodily functions. The endocrine system works closely with the nervous system to maintain homeostasis.

The MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM includes bones, muscles, and joints. Bones provide structural support and protection, while muscles enable movement. Together, these systems allow for locomotion and physical interaction with the environment.

The IMMUNE SYSTEM protects the body from pathogens and foreign substances. White blood cells and antibodies identify and neutralize threats, preventing infections and diseases.

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
============================================================================

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (heart attack) occurs when blood flow to part of the heart muscle is blocked, usually by a blood clot in a coronary artery. Patients typically present with chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment with aspirin, nitroglycerin, and emergency hospital care.

HYPERTENSION (high blood pressure) is a chronic condition where blood pressure remains elevated over time. It increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, and kidney damage. Treatment involves antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION is an irregular heart rhythm that increases stroke risk due to blood clot formation in the heart's atria. Patients experience palpitations and irregular heartbeat. Treatment includes anticoagulants to prevent clots and monitoring of blood clotting factors.

HEART FAILURE occurs when the heart cannot pump blood effectively. This leads to fluid accumulation in the lungs and body tissues, causing shortness of breath, edema, and fatigue. Treatment includes diuretics to remove excess fluid and ACE inhibitors to improve heart function.

CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE results from narrowing of the coronary arteries due to plaque buildup. This causes chest pain (angina) and increases heart attack risk. High cholesterol is a major risk factor. Treatment includes statins to lower cholesterol and procedures like angioplasty if needed.

DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS involves blood clot formation in deep veins, typically in the legs. It causes leg swelling and pain. DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism if the clot breaks free and travels to the lungs. Treatment requires anticoagulants like heparin and warfarin.

PULMONARY EMBOLISM occurs when a blood clot travels to and blocks a pulmonary artery. This causes shortness of breath, chest pain, and can be life-threatening. Emergency treatment includes thrombolysis to dissolve the clot and oxygen support.

============================================================================

============================================================================
GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASES
============================================================================

GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus due to weakening of the lower esophageal sphincter. This causes heartburn and regurgitation. Treatment includes proton pump inhibitors to reduce acid production and lifestyle modifications.

PEPTIC ULCER is an erosion in the stomach or duodenal lining, often caused by H. pylori infection or acid exposure. Patients experience abdominal pain and bloating. Treatment includes proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics to eradicate H. pylori.

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE (IBD) includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These autoimmune conditions cause chronic intestinal inflammation, leading to chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and blood in stool. Treatment includes mesalamine and immunosuppressants.

CIRRHOSIS is scarring of the liver due to chronic damage, often from alcohol abuse. It leads to liver dysfunction and complications like jaundice, ascites (fluid in abdomen), and confusion. Severe cases may require liver transplantation.

HEPATITIS is liver inflammation caused by viral infection. Types A, B, and C exist. Hepatitis C requires antiviral treatment, while hepatitis B has an available vaccine. Symptoms include jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain.

============================================================================
PHARMACOLOGY - DRUG CLASSES AND MECHANISMS
============================================================================

BETA-BLOCKERS are cardiovascular drugs that block beta-adrenergic receptors. They decrease heart rate and blood pressure, making them useful for treating hypertension and angina.

ACE INHIBITORS inhibit the ACE enzyme, preventing conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This causes vasodilation and lowers blood pressure, making them useful for hypertension and heart failure.

STATINS inhibit HMG-CoA reductase enzyme, decreasing cholesterol synthesis. They lower LDL cholesterol levels and reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with hyperlipidemia.

PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPIs) inhibit the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme in the stomach, suppressing gastric acid secretion. They heal ulcers and are used to treat GERD and peptic ulcers.

NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDs) inhibit COX enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin synthesis. They have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects but increase the risk of GI bleeding.

OPIOIDS bind to mu-opioid receptors, providing pain relief and sedation. However, they carry risks of respiratory depression and dependence.

BENZODIAZEPINES enhance GABA receptor activity, providing anxiolysis and sedation. They're used to treat anxiety but carry a risk of dependence.

PENICILLINS are beta-lactam antibiotics that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. They're bactericidal against gram-positive bacteria, though beta-lactamase resistance can occur.

FLUOROQUINOLONES inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase. They're broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotics used for UTIs but carry a risk of tendon rupture.

WARFARIN is an oral anticoagulant that inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, decreasing synthesis of clotting factors. It's used for atrial fibrillation but requires INR monitoring and increases bleeding risk.

INSULIN facilitates glucose uptake into cells, decreasing blood glucose. It's indicated for diabetes mellitus but carries a risk of hypoglycemia.

CORTICOSTEROIDS inhibit phospholipase enzyme, suppressing inflammation and immune response. They're used for autoimmune diseases but increase infection risk and cause osteoporosis.

============================================================================
DRUG INTERACTIONS
============================================================================

WARFARIN and NSAIDs should not be combined because warfarin inhibits blood clotting while NSAIDs damage the GI mucosa, greatly increasing GI bleeding risk.

STATINS and FIBRATES together increase the risk of myopathy and potentially life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. CPK monitoring is required.

ACE INHIBITORS with POTASSIUM SUPPLEMENTS can cause hyperkalemia because ACE inhibitors decrease potassium excretion. Serum potassium monitoring is essential.

SSRIs and MAOIs are absolutely contraindicated together because they can cause life-threatening serotonin syndrome. A two-week washout period is required when switching between them.

============================================================================
DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES
============================================================================

ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY uses ultrasound to visualize the heart. It evaluates cardiac function and detects valve abnormalities. This noninvasive procedure is indicated for heart failure.

CT SCANS use X-ray radiation to create cross-sectional images that identify pathology. They expose patients to radiation and may require IV contrast.

MRI uses magnetic fields to create detailed images. It's excellent for soft tissue visualization and doesn't use radiation, making it safer than CT. However, it's contraindicated with metal implants.

COLONOSCOPY uses an endoscope to visualize the colon. It detects polyps and can therapeutically remove them. It's indicated for colorectal cancer screening but requires bowel preparation.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) records electrical heart activity. It quickly and noninvasively detects arrhythmia abnormalities and is indicated for chest pain.

BLOOD CULTURES grow blood samples to identify bacteremia. They're indicated for sepsis and guide antibiotic choice.

LUMBAR PUNCTURE obtains CSF samples to examine cells. It's indicated for meningitis but carries a risk of headache and is contraindicated with increased intracranial pressure.

============================================================================
SURGICAL PROCEDURES
============================================================================

CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING (CABG) uses vein or artery grafts to bypass blocked coronary arteries. It's indicated for severe CAD and improves blood flow but carries stroke risk.

APPENDECTOMY removes the inflamed appendix. It's an urgent emergency procedure indicated for appendicitis that prevents peritonitis.

HIP REPLACEMENT replaces the hip joint with a prosthesis. It's indicated for osteoarthritis and improves mobility but requires physical therapy rehabilitation.

THYROIDECTOMY removes the thyroid gland. It's indicated for thyroid cancer or hyperthyroidism but requires lifelong levothyroxine replacement and carries a risk of hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve damage.

NEPHRECTOMY removes a kidney. It's indicated for renal cell carcinoma or non-functioning kidney. It can be curative for localized cancer if the remaining kidney has adequate function.
