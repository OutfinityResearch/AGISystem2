AUG is the start codon.
UAA, UAG, and UGA are stop codons.

# Mutations
A point mutation changes one base.
A frameshift mutation shifts the reading frame.
Mutations can be silent, missense, or nonsense.

# Inheritance
Mendelian inheritance follows dominant and recessive patterns.
A monohybrid cross gives a 3:1 ratio.
The law of segregation states alleles separate during meiosis.
The law of independent assortment states genes sort independently.

# Ecosystems
An ecosystem includes living and non-living components.
Terrestrial ecosystems are on land.
Aquatic ecosystems are in water.
Marine ecosystems are in salt water.
Freshwater ecosystems are in fresh water.

# Biomes
Tropical rainforests have high rainfall and biodiversity.
Deserts have low rainfall and extreme temperatures.
Tundra has permafrost and short growing seasons.
Grasslands have moderate rainfall and grasses dominate.
Temperate forests have seasonal changes.

# Ecological Relationships
Predation is when one organism eats another.
Parasitism benefits one organism at the expense of another.
Mutualism benefits both organisms.
Commensalism benefits one organism without harming another.
Competition harms both organisms competing for resources.

# Food Web
Producers make their own food through photosynthesis.
Primary consumers eat producers.
Secondary consumers eat primary consumers.
Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers.
Decomposers break down dead organic matter.
Only 10 percent of energy transfers between trophic levels.

# Biogeochemical Cycles
The carbon cycle moves carbon through ecosystems.
Photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Respiration releases carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
The nitrogen cycle moves nitrogen through ecosystems.
Nitrogen fixation converts N2 to ammonia.
Nitrification converts ammonia to nitrate.

# Population Ecology
Exponential growth occurs with unlimited resources.

Synaptic transmission occurs at synapses.

# Hormones
Hormones are chemical messengers.

T cells destroy infected cells.
Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins.

# Evolution
Evolution is change in allele frequencies over time.
Natural selection requires variation, heritability, and differential reproduction.
Genetic drift is random change in allele frequencies.
Gene flow is movement of alleles between populations.
Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation.

# Natural Selection Types
Directional selection favors one extreme phenotype.
Stabilizing selection favors the average phenotype.
Disruptive selection favors both extreme phenotypes.
Sexual selection involves mate choice.

# Speciation
Allopatric speciation requires geographic isolation.
Sympatric speciation occurs without geographic isolation.
Reproductive isolation prevents interbreeding.

# Evidence for Evolution
