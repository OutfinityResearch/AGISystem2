# Mathematics Theory - Natural Language Description

## Introduction

This theory covers fundamental concepts from pure mathematics, including set theory,
number theory, Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, mathematical logic, real analysis,
and probability theory. The axioms and theorems presented here form the foundation of
modern mathematical reasoning.

## Part I: Set Theory (Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms)

Set theory provides the foundational language for all of mathematics. The Axiom of
Extensionality states that two sets are equal if and only if they contain exactly
the same elements. The Empty Set Axiom guarantees the existence of a set with no
elements, denoted as the empty set.

The Pairing Axiom asserts that for any two objects, there exists a set containing
exactly those two objects. The Union Axiom states that for any collection of sets,
there exists a set containing all elements that belong to at least one set in the
collection.

The Power Set Axiom guarantees that for any set A, there exists a set containing
all subsets of A. Subset transitivity tells us that if A is a subset of B and B is
a subset of C, then A must be a subset of C.

De Morgan's Laws for sets describe the relationship between complements, unions,
and intersections: the complement of a union equals the intersection of the
complements, and the complement of an intersection equals the union of the complements.

The Distributive Laws show how union and intersection interact: A union (B intersect C)
equals (A union B) intersect (A union C), and similarly for the dual case.

## Part II: Number Theory (Peano Axioms)

The natural numbers are defined through Peano's five axioms. The first axiom states
that zero is a natural number. The second axiom establishes that every natural number
has a successor, which is also a natural number.

The third axiom asserts that zero is not the successor of any natural number,
establishing zero as the "first" natural number. The fourth axiom states that the
successor function is injective: if the successors of two numbers are equal, then
the numbers themselves are equal.

The fifth axiom is the Principle of Mathematical Induction, which states that if a
property holds for zero, and if whenever it holds for a number n it also holds for
the successor of n, then the property holds for all natural numbers.

Addition is defined recursively: n plus zero equals n, and n plus the successor of m
equals the successor of (n plus m). Addition is commutative (a + b = b + a) and
associative ((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)).

Multiplication is similarly defined: n times zero equals zero, and n times the
successor of m equals n plus (n times m). Multiplication is commutative, associative,
and distributes over addition.

The ordering relation on natural numbers satisfies transitivity: if a is less than
or equal to b, and b is less than or equal to c, then a is less than or equal to c.
Trichotomy ensures that for any two natural numbers, exactly one of three relations
holds: less than, equal to, or greater than.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every natural number greater than
one has a unique prime factorization. Bezout's Identity guarantees that for any two
natural numbers, their greatest common divisor can be expressed as a linear combination
of the two numbers.

## Part III: Euclidean Geometry

Euclid's five postulates define the foundations of plane geometry. The first postulate
states that a straight line can be drawn between any two points. The second postulate
allows any line segment to be extended indefinitely.

The third postulate asserts that given any point and any distance, a circle can be
drawn with that center and radius. The fourth postulate states that all right angles
are congruent. The fifth postulate, the Parallel Postulate, states that through a
point not on a given line, exactly one line parallel to the given line can be drawn.

The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse
equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Thales' Theorem asserts that
any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.

Triangle congruence can be established through three criteria: SSS (three sides equal),
SAS (two sides and the included angle equal), or ASA (two angles and the included
side equal). Similar triangles have proportional sides and equal corresponding angles.

The Triangle Inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a
triangle exceeds the length of the third side. The Midpoint Theorem shows that the
segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third
side and half its length.

## Part IV: Abstract Algebra (Group Theory)

A group is a set equipped with a binary operation satisfying four axioms. Closure
requires that combining any two elements produces an element in the set. Associativity
requires that the grouping of operations does not affect the result.

The Identity axiom requires the existence of an element that leaves all other elements
unchanged when combined with them. The Inverse axiom requires that every element has
an inverse that combines with it to produce the identity.

An Abelian (commutative) group additionally satisfies that the order of operations
does not matter. Lagrange's Theorem states that the order of any subgroup divides
the order of the group.

The First Isomorphism Theorem establishes a fundamental connection between
homomorphisms, quotient groups, and images: the quotient of the domain by the kernel
is isomorphic to the image.

A ring is an algebraic structure with two operations (addition and multiplication)
where addition forms an Abelian group and multiplication is associative and distributes
over addition. A field is a commutative ring where every non-zero element has a
multiplicative inverse.

## Part V: Mathematical Logic

Modus Ponens is the fundamental rule of logical inference: if P is true and P implies Q
is true, then Q must be true. Modus Tollens is its contrapositive form: if Q is false
and P implies Q, then P must be false.

Hypothetical Syllogism chains implications: if P implies Q and Q implies R, then P
implies R. Disjunctive Syllogism derives conclusions from disjunctions: if P or Q
is true and P is false, then Q must be true.

De Morgan's Laws for logic describe the negation of conjunctions and disjunctions:
not (P and Q) equals (not P) or (not Q), and not (P or Q) equals (not P) and (not Q).

The Law of Excluded Middle asserts that for any proposition P, either P or not-P is
true. Reductio ad Absurdum allows us to conclude not-P if assuming P leads to a
contradiction.

Quantifier rules include Universal Instantiation (from "for all x, P(x)" conclude
"P(a)" for any specific a) and Existential Generalization (from "P(a)" for some
specific a, conclude "there exists x such that P(x)").

## Part VI: Real Analysis

The limit of a function at a point is defined using the epsilon-delta criterion: for
every epsilon greater than zero, there exists a delta greater than zero such that if
the distance from x to a is less than delta, then the distance from f(x) to L is less
than epsilon.

A function is continuous at a point if the limit at that point equals the function value
at that point. The sum and product of continuous functions are continuous.

The Intermediate Value Theorem states that if a continuous function takes values f(a)
and f(b) at the endpoints of an interval, then it takes every value between f(a) and
f(b) at some point in the interval.

The derivative of a function at a point is the limit of the difference quotient as the
increment approaches zero. Differentiability implies continuity. The Power Rule,
Product Rule, Quotient Rule, and Chain Rule provide methods for computing derivatives.

The Mean Value Theorem states that for a function continuous on a closed interval
and differentiable on the open interval, there exists a point where the derivative
equals the average rate of change. Rolle's Theorem is the special case where the
endpoints have equal values.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects differentiation and integration: the
derivative of the integral function equals the original function, and the definite
integral equals the difference of antiderivative values at the endpoints.

## Part VII: Probability Theory

Probability is formalized through Kolmogorov's axioms. The probability of any event
is between zero and one. The probability of the entire sample space is one. For
mutually exclusive events, the probability of their union equals the sum of their
probabilities.

The Complement Rule states that the probability of an event not occurring equals one
minus the probability of it occurring. The Addition Rule for any two events states
that P(A or B) equals P(A) plus P(B) minus P(A and B).

Conditional probability P(A|B) is defined as P(A and B) divided by P(B). Two events
are independent if and only if P(A and B) equals P(A) times P(B).

Bayes' Theorem relates conditional probabilities: P(A|B) equals P(B|A) times P(A)
divided by P(B). The Law of Total Probability expresses the probability of an event
as a sum over a partition.

The expected value is linear: E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y), and E(cX) = c*E(X). Variance
measures the spread of a distribution: Var(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2.

Chebyshev's Inequality bounds the probability of deviating from the mean:
P(|X - E(X)| >= k*sigma) <= 1/k^2.

The Law of Large Numbers states that the sample mean converges to the expected value
as the sample size increases. The Central Limit Theorem states that the standardized
sum of independent random variables converges to a standard normal distribution.
