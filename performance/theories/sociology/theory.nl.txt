Sociology Theory - Natural Language Description

INTRODUCTION
============
Sociology is the systematic study of human society, social behavior, and the relationships between individuals and groups. It examines how social structures, institutions, and cultural patterns shape human behavior and experiences. This theory encompasses the fundamental concepts, processes, and perspectives that sociologists use to understand social life.

SOCIAL STRUCTURES AND GROUPS
=============================

Social Groups
-------------
A social group is a collection of individuals who interact regularly, share common identity, and have defined boundaries. Groups are the building blocks of society and provide members with identity, belonging, and social support.

Primary Groups
--------------
Primary groups are characterized by intimate, long-lasting relationships and face-to-face interaction. The family is the most important primary group, providing emotional support and primary socialization. These groups involve deep emotional bonds and are essential for individual well-being.

Secondary Groups
----------------
Secondary groups are larger, more impersonal, and organized around specific goals. Examples include work organizations, schools, and professional associations. Relationships in secondary groups are more formal and task-oriented than in primary groups.

In-Groups and Out-Groups
-------------------------
An in-group is a social group with which an individual identifies and feels loyalty. It creates a sense of "we-ness" and solidarity among members. An out-group is a group that an individual does not belong to and may view with competition or prejudice. The distinction between in-groups and out-groups helps maintain group boundaries and identity.

Reference Groups
----------------
Reference groups provide standards for evaluating oneself and one's behavior. People may use reference groups they aspire to join as benchmarks for their attitudes and actions. Reference groups influence behavior even when individuals are not members.

Social Networks
---------------
Social networks consist of individuals connected by social ties of varying strength. Network structure affects the flow of information, resources, and influence. Strong ties provide emotional support, while weak ties often provide access to new information and opportunities through bridging different social circles.

Social Capital
--------------
Social capital refers to the resources available through social networks, including trust, reciprocity, and cooperation. It facilitates collective action and provides individuals with access to opportunities and support. Social capital can be bonding (within groups) or bridging (across groups).

Community
---------
A community is a social group that shares geographic territory, regular interaction, and common identity. Communities create a sense of belonging and provide mutual support. In modern society, communities can also be virtual, based on shared interests rather than physical proximity.

SOCIAL STRATIFICATION
======================

Social Stratification Systems
------------------------------
Social stratification is the hierarchical arrangement of individuals and groups in society based on unequal distribution of resources, power, and prestige. All complex societies have some form of stratification that creates systematic inequality.

Social Class
------------
Social class is a category of people who share similar economic positions, occupational status, and life chances. Class position affects access to resources, opportunities, and power. In open class systems, social mobility between classes is possible through achievement.

Class Systems
-------------
Class systems are based on achievement and allow for social mobility. Modern capitalist societies are typically class systems where position is theoretically determined by merit and achievement. However, ascribed characteristics like family background still significantly influence class position.

Caste Systems
-------------
Caste systems are closed stratification systems based on ascribed status determined at birth. They feature rigid boundaries between castes with little or no mobility. Traditional Indian society exemplifies a caste system with religious justification for hierarchy.

Social Status
-------------
Status refers to the prestige and honor associated with a social position. It involves social recognition and can be achieved or ascribed. People display status through symbols like clothing, possessions, and lifestyle choices.

Power
-----
Power is the ability to control resources and influence others' behavior. It can be legitimate (authority) or coercive. Power is unequally distributed in society and often accompanies wealth and prestige, though the dimensions can vary independently.

Weber's Stratification Theory
------------------------------
Max Weber identified three independent dimensions of stratification: class (economic position), status (prestige and honor), and party (political power). This multidimensional approach recognizes that stratification is more complex than economic position alone.

Marx's Class Theory
-------------------
Karl Marx focused on economic class as the fundamental division in capitalist society. He identified the bourgeoisie (owners of means of production) and proletariat (workers) as antagonistic classes. Marx predicted class conflict would lead to revolutionary change as workers developed class consciousness.

Social Mobility
---------------
Social mobility refers to movement between social positions. Vertical mobility involves moving up or down the stratification hierarchy, while horizontal mobility involves changing positions at the same level. Intergenerational mobility compares parents' and children's positions, while intragenerational mobility tracks changes within a lifetime.

Upward and Downward Mobility
-----------------------------
Upward mobility involves gaining higher status, income, or power through achievement, education, or opportunity. Downward mobility involves loss of status or resources due to economic changes, personal circumstances, or structural factors. Mobility rates indicate how open a society's stratification system is.

Inequality
----------
Social inequality refers to unequal distribution of resources, opportunities, and rewards. It manifests in economic, social, and political forms. High levels of inequality can create social problems, reduce social cohesion, and limit opportunities for disadvantaged groups.

Poverty
-------
Poverty is the condition of lacking adequate resources for subsistence. Absolute poverty is inability to meet basic needs, while relative poverty involves having significantly less than average in society. Poverty cycles can trap families across generations through limited opportunities.

Wealth Concentration
--------------------
Wealth concentration refers to accumulation of assets among a small elite. It creates extreme inequality and grants the wealthy disproportionate political power. Wealth concentration has increased in many societies, raising concerns about democracy and opportunity.

SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS
===================

Social Institutions
-------------------
Social institutions are organized, persistent patterns of social relationships and practices that meet basic societal needs. They include family, education, economy, government, and religion. Institutions provide structure, stability, and continuity to social life.

Family Institution
------------------
The family is a fundamental institution based on kinship ties. It performs crucial functions including biological reproduction, primary socialization of children, economic support, and emotional care. Family forms vary across cultures and have changed historically.

Nuclear and Extended Families
------------------------------
The nuclear family consists of parents and their dependent children in a single household. It is the predominant form in modern industrial societies. The extended family includes multiple generations and broader kinship networks, providing mutual support and being more common in traditional societies.

Marriage
--------
Marriage is a socially recognized union between individuals, typically creating kinship ties and legitimizing children. Marriage norms vary by culture, including rules about whom one can marry, number of spouses, and gender arrangements. Marriage patterns are changing in modern societies.

Education Institution
---------------------
Education formally transmits knowledge, skills, and cultural values to new generations. It performs secondary socialization, prepares individuals for occupational roles, and affects social stratification through credentialing and social selection.

Formal Education
----------------
Formal education occurs in schools following standardized curricula and leading to credentials. It certifies competence and affects life chances. Schools also transmit cultural values and sort individuals into different social positions.

Hidden Curriculum
-----------------
The hidden curriculum consists of implicit lessons schools teach about conformity, obedience, and social norms. Students learn appropriate behavior, attitudes toward authority, and their place in social hierarchies through school organization and practices.

Credentialism
-------------
Credentialism is the emphasis on educational credentials for determining qualifications and status. It can lead to credential inflation where increasing levels of education are required for the same jobs. This makes education increasingly essential for social mobility.

Economic Institution
--------------------
The economy organizes production, distribution, and exchange of goods and services. Economic systems shape class structure, inequality, and life chances. The organization of work affects daily life and social relationships.

Capitalism and Socialism
-------------------------
Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership, free markets, and profit motive. It features competition and unequal outcomes. Socialism emphasizes collective ownership, central planning, and goals of economic equality and social welfare. Most societies mix elements of both systems.

Political Institution
---------------------
Political institutions organize power, authority, and governance. The state claims legitimate monopoly on force within a territory. Political systems determine how decisions are made, how power is distributed, and citizens' rights and freedoms.

Democracy and Authoritarianism
-------------------------------
Democracy features elections, political participation, civil rights, and representation. Power is dispersed and leaders are accountable. Authoritarianism concentrates power in few hands, limits freedoms, and suppresses opposition. Political systems vary along this spectrum.

Religion Institution
--------------------
Religion is a system of beliefs, rituals, and practices concerning the sacred. It provides meaning, reinforces social solidarity, offers comfort, and exercises social control. Religious institutions have been central to most societies throughout history.

Religious Functions
-------------------
Religion performs multiple functions: providing life meaning and purpose, creating community solidarity, offering comfort in times of stress, and legitimating social norms and authority. These functions can be manifest (recognized) or latent (unrecognized).

Secularization
--------------
Secularization is the declining influence of religion in society. It involves institutional differentiation where religion's social functions are taken over by specialized secular institutions. Modern societies tend toward secularization, though religion remains important for many individuals.

SOCIALIZATION
=============

Socialization Process
---------------------
Socialization is the lifelong process through which individuals learn their culture, develop selfhood, and internalize social norms. It transforms biological beings into social beings capable of functioning in society. Socialization continues throughout life as people encounter new roles and situations.

Primary Socialization
---------------------
Primary socialization occurs in early childhood, mainly in the family. It involves learning language, basic skills, and fundamental values. Primary socialization forms the foundation of personality and is the most intensive period of social learning.

Secondary Socialization
-----------------------
Secondary socialization occurs later in life through institutions like schools, peer groups, and workplaces. It teaches specific roles, specialized skills, and knowledge needed for participation in various social contexts.

Agents of Socialization
-----------------------
Socialization occurs through various agents including family, peer groups, schools, and mass media. Each agent contributes different content and has varying influence at different life stages. Multiple agents can sometimes transmit contradictory messages.

Peer Socialization
------------------
Peer groups consist of individuals of similar age and status. They provide independence from adult authority, transmit youth culture and values, and exert peer pressure for conformity. Peers become increasingly important during adolescence.

Media Socialization
-------------------
Mass media transmit cultural messages, values, and representations of social reality to wide audiences. Media influence attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of the world. Concerns exist about media effects on violence, stereotypes, and consumer culture.

Self Development
----------------
The self is the individual's conscious, reflexive sense of personal identity. Self-development requires social interaction through which individuals learn to see themselves from others' perspectives. The self is both individual and social, shaped by interaction.

Looking-Glass Self
------------------
Charles Cooley's looking-glass self theory suggests we develop our self-concept based on how we imagine others perceive us. The process involves imagining our appearance to others, interpreting their judgment, and developing self-feelings based on these perceptions.

Role-Taking
-----------
George Herbert Mead emphasized role-taking—adopting others' perspectives to understand their viewpoints. Role-taking develops through stages and enables empathy and social understanding. It is essential for coordinating social interaction.

Generalized Other
-----------------
Mead's concept of the generalized other represents the internalized attitudes and expectations of society as a whole. It allows individuals to regulate their behavior according to social norms without direct supervision. The generalized other is the final stage of self-development.

Resocialization
---------------
Resocialization involves significant change in identity, values, and behaviors. It requires unlearning old norms and learning new ones. Resocialization can be voluntary or involuntary and often occurs in total institutions.

Total Institutions
------------------
Total institutions are places where residents are isolated from society and controlled by administrators. Examples include prisons, mental hospitals, and military boot camps. Total institutions attempt comprehensive resocialization through control of all aspects of life.

CULTURE
=======

Culture Concept
---------------
Culture consists of shared knowledge, beliefs, values, norms, and material objects that people create and use. It is learned through socialization, transmitted through symbols, and is adaptive. Culture shapes perception, behavior, and social organization.

Material and Nonmaterial Culture
---------------------------------
Material culture includes physical objects and technology. Nonmaterial culture includes values, beliefs, norms, and symbols. The two aspects are interrelated as material culture reflects cultural values and nonmaterial culture guides use of objects.

Cultural Values
---------------
Values are shared conceptions of what is desirable and worth striving for. They provide standards for judging behavior and guide life choices. Values are culture-specific though some may be widely shared across societies.

Social Norms
------------
Norms are rules defining appropriate and expected behavior in specific situations. They are enforced through sanctions—rewards for conformity and punishments for violation. Norms maintain order and make social life predictable.

Folkways, Mores, and Taboos
----------------------------
Folkways are informal norms governing everyday behavior with mild sanctions for violation. Mores are norms based on moral beliefs with strong sanctions for violation. Taboos are the strongest norms, prohibiting behaviors considered deeply offensive with severe sanctions.

Cultural Symbols
----------------
Symbols are things that represent something else and carry shared meaning. They enable communication and transmission of culture. The relationship between symbols and their meanings is often arbitrary and culturally specific.

Language
--------
Language is a system of symbols with rules (grammar) enabling communication. It is the most important symbol system, allowing complex thought and cultural transmission. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis suggests language shapes thought and perception.

Subculture and Counterculture
------------------------------
A subculture is a group sharing distinctive culture while participating in larger society. Countercultures actively oppose and reject dominant cultural values, promoting alternative values and lifestyles. Both represent cultural diversity within societies.

Cultural Diversity and Pluralism
---------------------------------
Cultural diversity refers to variety of cultural patterns within and across societies. Cultural pluralism is a model where diverse cultural groups coexist with mutual respect and maintain distinctive identities while sharing common institutions.

Ethnocentrism and Cultural Relativism
--------------------------------------
Ethnocentrism is judging other cultures by standards of one's own culture, typically viewing one's own as superior. Cultural relativism is understanding cultures in their own terms without judgment. Cultural relativism promotes tolerance but raises questions about universal standards.

Cultural Change
---------------
Culture changes through innovation, discovery, diffusion from other cultures, and globalization. Cultural change can create benefits but also resistance from those invested in traditional ways. The pace and direction of change varies across societies and cultural domains.

Cultural Lag
------------
William Ogburn's concept of cultural lag describes the gap between technological change and cultural adaptation. Material culture (technology) often changes faster than nonmaterial culture (values, norms), creating social problems until culture adjusts.

DEVIANCE AND SOCIAL CONTROL
============================

Deviance
--------
Deviance is violation of social norms. It is relative, varying by culture, historical period, situation, and social status of the actor and audience. What is considered deviant is socially defined through labeling processes.

Positive and Negative Deviance
-------------------------------
Negative deviance involves underconformity to norms, violating expectations in disapproved ways. Positive deviance involves overconformity, exceeding norms in ways that may be admired or create discomfort. Both types depart from normal expectations.

Crime
-----
Crime is deviance involving violation of formal laws subject to punishment by the state. Crime threatens social order and generates formal responses from the criminal justice system. Crime rates and types vary significantly across societies and groups.

White-Collar Crime
------------------
White-collar crime refers to offenses committed by high-status individuals in occupational contexts. Examples include fraud, embezzlement, and corporate crime. White-collar crime often causes greater financial harm than street crime but is less often prosecuted.

Social Control
--------------
Social control consists of mechanisms promoting conformity to norms. It operates through formal means (laws, police, courts) and informal means (socialization, peer pressure, shame). Social control maintains order but can be oppressive.

Formal and Informal Control
----------------------------
Formal control is exercised through official institutions like police and courts using codified rules and sanctions. Informal control operates through everyday interactions using social pressure, disapproval, and other unofficial sanctions. Informal control is more common and usually more effective.

Labeling Theory
---------------
Labeling theory emphasizes that deviance is socially constructed through definition and reaction. Being labeled deviant affects identity and future behavior. The theory highlights how social reaction can amplify deviance rather than control it.

Primary and Secondary Deviance
-------------------------------
Edwin Lemert distinguished primary deviance (initial violations with limited consequences) from secondary deviance (deviance that follows labeling and becomes organized around deviant identity). Labeling can transform primary into secondary deviance.

Strain Theory
-------------
Robert Merton's strain theory argues deviance results from gap between cultural goals and legitimate means to achieve them. When legitimate opportunities are blocked, individuals may pursue goals through deviance or reject the goals. This explains class patterns in deviance.

Anomie
------
Emile Durkheim's concept of anomie describes normlessness and moral confusion occurring during rapid social change when norms break down. Anomie increases deviance as individuals lack clear guidelines. Merton adapted this concept to explain American culture's emphasis on success.

Differential Association Theory
--------------------------------
Edwin Sutherland's differential association theory argues criminal behavior is learned through interaction with others who define law violation favorably. Individuals learn techniques, motives, and rationalizations for crime. This explains how deviance concentrates in certain networks.

Control Theory
--------------
Travis Hirschi's control theory asks why people conform rather than why they deviate. It emphasizes social bonds—attachment to others, commitment to conventional goals, involvement in conventional activities, and belief in norms. Weak bonds enable deviance.

SOCIAL CHANGE
=============

Social Change
-------------
Social change is transformation of social patterns over time. It affects social structures, institutions, relationships, and culture. Change can be planned or unplanned, gradual or rapid, progressive or regressive. Understanding change is central to sociology.

Evolutionary Change
-------------------
Evolutionary theories view change as gradual development through stages. Early sociologists often saw change as progress toward more complex, better societies. Modern evolutionary approaches avoid assumptions about progress while recognizing directional patterns.

Revolutionary Change
--------------------
Revolutionary change involves rapid, fundamental transformation of social systems. Revolutions dramatically reorganize power, institutions, and culture. They typically involve conflict and often violence, emerging from contradictions in existing systems.

Modernization
-------------
Modernization is the transformation from traditional to modern society involving industrialization, urbanization, rationalization, and cultural change. It brings benefits like increased productivity and rights but also problems like inequality and alienation.

Globalization
-------------
Globalization is increasing integration and interconnection of societies worldwide. It involves flows of goods, capital, people, ideas, and culture across national boundaries. Globalization creates opportunities but also increases inequality and cultural homogenization.

Urbanization
------------
Urbanization is the growth of cities and urban population. It results from rural-urban migration and natural increase. Urbanization transforms social relationships, creating more diversity but also anonymity and potential isolation. Urban life differs significantly from rural.

Industrialization
-----------------
Industrialization involves shift from agricultural to manufacturing economy using mechanized technology. It increases productivity and wealth but also creates new class structures, changes family patterns, and generates environmental problems. Industrial societies differ fundamentally from pre-industrial.

Social Movements
----------------
Social movements are organized collective efforts to promote or resist social change. They emerge when groups mobilize resources to pursue change goals. Movements vary in tactics, goals, and degree of challenge to existing systems.

Reform and Revolutionary Movements
-----------------------------------
Reform movements seek limited changes in specific areas while accepting the basic system. Revolutionary movements seek fundamental transformation of society, challenging existing power structures. The distinction reflects degree of change sought.

Resource Mobilization Theory
-----------------------------
Resource mobilization theory analyzes how movements acquire and use resources including money, members, legitimacy, and leadership. Successful movements effectively mobilize resources and create organizations. This approach views movements as rational strategic actors.

Collective Behavior
-------------------
Collective behavior includes spontaneous, relatively unstructured social behavior like crowds, riots, and fads. It emerges in situations where institutional norms break down. Collective behavior can develop into more organized social movements.

Technology and Social Change
-----------------------------
Technological innovation drives social change by transforming work, communication, and daily life. Technology enables new possibilities but also creates problems. Technological determinism argues technology drives social change, though this view is contested.

SOCIOLOGICAL THEORIES
======================

Functionalism
-------------
Functionalism views society as a system of interrelated parts working together to maintain stability. Each institution performs functions contributing to social equilibrium. Problems arise when parts fail to function properly. Functionalism emphasizes consensus and integration.

Manifest and Latent Functions
------------------------------
Robert Merton distinguished manifest functions (intended, recognized consequences) from latent functions (unintended, unrecognized consequences). Analyzing both types reveals fuller understanding of social phenomena. Actions often have important unintended consequences.

Dysfunction
-----------
Dysfunctions are consequences that disrupt social equilibrium and threaten stability. They can be manifest or latent. What is functional for one group may be dysfunctional for another, revealing value choices in functionalist analysis.

Conflict Theory
---------------
Conflict theory emphasizes inequality, power relations, and competition over resources. It views society as arena of conflict between groups with different interests. Social change results from conflict. Conflict theory critiques how powerful groups maintain advantage.

Class Conflict
--------------
Karl Marx's theory of class conflict focuses on antagonism between capitalist owners and workers. Economic structure determines other social arrangements. Marx predicted increasing exploitation would lead to working class revolution and transformation to socialism.

Gender Conflict
---------------
Feminist conflict theory analyzes patriarchy and male domination as fundamental sources of inequality. It examines how gender relations involve power and how institutions perpetuate gender inequality. Gender conflict theory advocates transformation of gender relations toward equality.

Symbolic Interactionism
-----------------------
Symbolic interactionism focuses on micro-level social interaction through symbols, especially language. It emphasizes how people create meaning through interaction and construct social reality. Society emerges from countless everyday interactions.

Definition of the Situation
----------------------------
W.I. Thomas argued that if people define situations as real, they are real in their consequences. How we interpret situations affects how we act. Social reality is constructed through shared definitions. Understanding requires grasping actors' perspectives.

Dramaturgy
----------
Erving Goffman's dramaturgical approach uses theater metaphor to analyze social interaction as performance. People manage impressions, present selves strategically, and maintain frontstage (public) and backstage (private) regions. Social life involves performance.

Impression Management
---------------------
Impression management involves strategic presentation of self to control others' perceptions. People perform roles, use props and settings, and coordinate performances with others. Successful interaction requires managing impressions to maintain definitions of situations.

Exchange Theory
---------------
Exchange theory analyzes social interaction as exchange of rewards and costs. People seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs in rational calculations. Relationships continue when both parties receive adequate rewards. This applies to various social phenomena.

Feminist Theory
---------------
Feminist theory analyzes gender relations and patriarchy, advocating gender equality. It examines how gender is socially constructed and how gender inequality is maintained. Feminist theory recognizes diversity among women and intersections with race, class, and sexuality.

Critical Race Theory
--------------------
Critical race theory examines how race and racism are embedded in social structures and culture. It challenges color-blind approaches, arguing racism is systemic not just individual. CRT analyzes how law and institutions maintain racial inequality.

Postmodern Theory
-----------------
Postmodern theory questions grand narratives and universal truths, emphasizing fragmentation, plurality, and deconstruction. It sees reality as socially constructed through discourse. Postmodernism challenges foundational assumptions of modern social theory.

RACE AND ETHNICITY
==================

Race
----
Race is a social construction based on perceived physical characteristics. Racial categories are arbitrary and vary across societies. Race has profound social consequences despite lacking biological basis. Race shapes identity, experiences, and life chances.

Ethnicity
---------
Ethnicity refers to shared cultural characteristics including ancestry, language, religion, and customs. Ethnic identity involves sense of common heritage and distinctiveness. Unlike race, ethnicity is based on cultural rather than physical traits.

Racism
------
Racism is prejudice and discrimination based on race combined with power to enforce it. It operates at individual and institutional levels. Racism creates systematic disadvantage for minority groups and advantages for dominant racial groups.

Individual and Institutional Racism
------------------------------------
Individual racism involves personal prejudiced attitudes and discriminatory behaviors. Institutional racism involves policies and practices embedded in institutions that systematically disadvantage racial minorities. Institutional racism can operate without conscious prejudice.

Prejudice and Discrimination
-----------------------------
Prejudice is negative attitude or judgment about a group and its members based on stereotypes. Discrimination is unequal treatment based on group membership. Prejudice is attitude; discrimination is action. They often but don't always occur together.

Segregation
-----------
Segregation is physical and social separation of racial or ethnic groups. It can be legal (de jure) or by custom and practice (de facto). Segregation maintains inequality by limiting minority access to resources and opportunities.

Assimilation and Pluralism
---------------------------
Assimilation involves minorities adopting dominant culture and being absorbed into mainstream. Pluralism maintains cultural diversity with groups coexisting equally while preserving distinctive identities. These represent different models of intergroup relations.

Minority Groups
---------------
Minority groups occupy subordinate positions in social hierarchy, experience discrimination, and have distinctive characteristics. Minority status is defined by power relations, not numerical size. Minorities typically have strong group identity due to shared experiences.

GENDER AND SEXUALITY
====================

Gender
------
Gender is the social and cultural meanings attached to biological sex categories. Gender roles, identities, and relations are socially constructed and vary across cultures. Gender is performed and learned, not biologically determined.

Sex
---
Sex refers to biological characteristics including chromosomes, hormones, and anatomy. The sex binary (male/female) is challenged by existence of intersex individuals. Sex is distinct from gender though the two are often confused.

Gender Roles
------------
Gender roles are expectations about appropriate behaviors, attitudes, and traits for males and females. They are learned through socialization and enforced through sanctions. Gender roles vary across cultures and have changed historically.

Gender Stratification
---------------------
Gender stratification refers to hierarchical ranking of genders with unequal access to resources, power, and prestige. In most societies, men dominate women through patriarchal systems. Gender inequality manifests in economic, political, and social spheres.

Patriarchy
----------
Patriarchy is a system of male dominance where men hold power in family, economy, and politics. Patriarchal norms are embedded in institutions and culture. Patriarchy disadvantages women while granting men privileges, though it constrains men too.

Sexism
------
Sexism is prejudice and discrimination based on gender. It involves believing one sex is inferior and treating people unequally based on gender. Sexism can be individual or institutional and affects opportunities, treatment, and outcomes.

Feminism
--------
Feminism is a social movement and theory advocating gender equality and women's empowerment. Feminist activism has achieved significant changes in women's rights and opportunities. Feminism includes diverse perspectives and addresses intersections with race and class.

Sexual Orientation
------------------
Sexual orientation refers to patterns of sexual and emotional attraction. It includes heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, and other identities. Sexual orientation is distinct from gender identity and forms in complex ways involving multiple factors.

Heteronormativity
-----------------
Heteronormativity is the assumption that heterosexuality is normal, natural, and privileged. It marginalizes non-heterosexual orientations and enforces conformity to gender norms. Heteronormativity is embedded in institutions, laws, and culture.

Gender Identity
---------------
Gender identity is one's internal sense of being male, female, or another gender. Most people are cisgender (identifying with sex assigned at birth). Transgender individuals identify with gender different from sex assigned at birth. Gender identity involves self-perception and social recognition.

WORK AND ECONOMY
================

Division of Labor
-----------------
Division of labor involves specialization where individuals perform specific tasks. It increases efficiency but creates interdependence. Durkheim analyzed how division of labor creates social solidarity in modern societies while also potentially causing anomie.

Alienation
----------
Marx's concept of alienation describes workers' separation from and powerlessness over their labor in capitalism. Workers lack control over production process, products, and working conditions. Alienation causes psychological and social problems.

Bureaucracy
-----------
Max Weber analyzed bureaucracy as formal organization based on rational principles including hierarchy, written rules, specialized roles, and impersonality. Bureaucracy is efficient for large organizations but can be rigid and dehumanizing.

Rationalization
---------------
Rationalization involves emphasis on efficiency, calculation, and rational means-ends thinking. Weber saw rationalization as defining characteristic of modern society. It brings technical benefits but can undermine substantive values and create an "iron cage."

McDonaldization
---------------
George Ritzer's concept of McDonaldization extends Weber's rationalization thesis. Fast food restaurants exemplify principles of efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control. These principles spread throughout society with benefits and drawbacks.

Occupational Prestige
---------------------
Occupations vary in prestige based on social evaluation. Prestige correlates with education, income, and power but is distinct dimension. Occupational prestige rankings are remarkably consistent across societies and time.

Labor Market
------------
Labor markets match workers with jobs through supply and demand. Markets are segmented with different conditions and opportunities. Primary sector jobs offer security and mobility; secondary sector jobs are unstable and low-paying.

Unemployment
------------
Unemployment involves being without paid work while seeking employment. It has economic consequences (lost income) and social-psychological consequences (reduced well-being, identity loss). Unemployment rates vary by economic conditions and social groups.

Globalized Economy
------------------
Economic globalization involves increasing international integration through trade, investment, and production. Multinational corporations dominate global economy. Globalization creates opportunities but increases inequality and vulnerability to distant events.

DEMOGRAPHY AND POPULATION
==========================

Population
----------
Demography studies population size, composition, and distribution. Population characteristics affect social organization and change. Demographic processes include fertility, mortality, and migration.

Demographic Transition
----------------------
Demographic transition model describes historical shift from high birth and death rates to low rates accompanying modernization. The transition occurs in stages and affects population growth rates. Most developed countries have completed transition.

Fertility Rate
--------------
Fertility rate measures births per woman. It is influenced by social factors including education, economy, culture, and women's status. Fertility declined dramatically with modernization as children became costly rather than economically beneficial.

Mortality Rate
--------------
Mortality rate measures deaths in population. It is affected by health conditions, medical care, sanitation, and nutrition. Declining mortality due to modernization led to population growth and increased life expectancy.

Migration
---------
Migration is geographic movement of populations. It affects both sending and receiving areas. Migration is driven by push factors (problems in origin) and pull factors (opportunities in destination). Migration significantly affects population composition.

Immigration and Emigration
---------------------------
Immigration is entry into a destination country. Emigration is departure from origin country. Immigration affects cultural diversity, labor markets, and social dynamics. Immigration policy regulates flows and integration.

Population Growth
-----------------
Population growth results from births, deaths, and migration. Rapid growth strains resources and environment. Growth rates vary dramatically across societies with poor countries growing faster than rich countries.

Overpopulation
--------------
Overpopulation occurs when population exceeds sustainable resource levels. Thomas Malthus predicted population growth would outpace food supply, leading to crisis. Modern concerns focus on environmental sustainability and resource depletion.

ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY
========================

Environmental Sociology
-----------------------
Environmental sociology studies relationships between society and environment. It examines how social organization affects environment and how environmental changes affect society. Central concerns include sustainability and environmental justice.

Ecological Footprint
--------------------
Ecological footprint measures resource consumption and environmental impact. Modern lifestyles, especially in wealthy nations, have large footprints exceeding sustainable levels. Reducing footprints requires changes in consumption patterns and technology.

Environmental Racism
--------------------
Environmental racism involves disproportionate exposure of racial minorities to environmental hazards and pollution. It reflects unequal power in decisions about facility siting and enforcement. Environmental justice movements challenge this inequality.

Sustainable Development
-----------------------
Sustainable development balances economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection. It meets present needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs. Achieving sustainability requires transforming economic systems and values.

Climate Change
--------------
Climate change involves global warming and environmental changes from greenhouse gas emissions. It has severe social consequences including displacement, conflicts, and health impacts. Climate change exacerbates global inequalities as poor countries suffer most despite contributing least to the problem.
