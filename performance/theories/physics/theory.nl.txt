PHYSICS THEORY - COMPREHENSIVE NATURAL LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION

This comprehensive physics theory encompasses fundamental concepts spanning classical mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, optics, and modern physics. The theory is grounded in the International System of Units (SI) and establishes rigorous connections between theoretical principles and measurable quantities.

INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS (SI)

The foundation of physics measurements rests on seven base units. The meter defines length as a fundamental spatial dimension, measured through standardized distance. The kilogram quantifies mass, representing an object's resistance to acceleration and its gravitational property. The second measures time, based on the precise oscillations of cesium atoms. The ampere defines electric current as the flow of charge per unit time. The kelvin measures absolute temperature, with zero kelvin representing the complete absence of thermal energy. The mole quantifies the amount of substance in terms of particle count, specifically Avogadro's number of particles. The candela measures luminous intensity, describing the brightness of light sources.

From these base units, derived units emerge to describe complex physical phenomena. The newton combines mass and acceleration to quantify force. The joule measures energy as the product of force and distance. The watt describes power as the rate of energy transfer per unit time. The pascal quantifies pressure as force distributed over area. The coulomb measures electric charge as the product of current and time. The volt describes electric potential as energy per unit charge. The ohm quantifies electrical resistance through the relationship between voltage and current. The tesla measures magnetic field strength as flux per unit area. The hertz describes frequency as cycles per unit time.

SI prefixes provide systematic scaling across orders of magnitude. Kilo multiplies by one thousand, mega by one million. Conversely, milli divides by one thousand, micro by one millionth. These prefixes enable precise description of phenomena ranging from astronomical distances to subatomic scales.

CLASSICAL MECHANICS - FOUNDATIONS OF MOTION

Newton's laws establish the fundamental principles governing motion and force. The first law, the principle of inertia, states that objects maintain constant velocity unless acted upon by external forces. Objects at rest remain at rest, and objects in motion continue with unchanging velocity, absent external influence. The second law provides the quantitative foundation of dynamics, establishing that force equals mass times acceleration. This fundamental relationship enables calculation of motion under known forces. The third law declares that forces occur in equal and opposite pairs - every action generates a simultaneous and equal reaction on different bodies.

Kinematics describes motion mathematically. Velocity represents the rate of displacement over time, a vector quantity with both magnitude and direction. Acceleration measures the rate of velocity change, also a vector quantity. Kinematic equations relate position, velocity, acceleration, and time for objects under constant acceleration, enabling prediction of future motion states from initial conditions.

Momentum, the product of mass and velocity, provides an alternative framework for analyzing motion. The impulse-momentum theorem connects force applied over time to the resulting change in momentum, offering insights into collision and impact phenomena.

DYNAMICS AND FORCES

Gravitational force follows an inverse square law, with attraction proportional to the product of masses and inversely proportional to the square of separation distance. Weight, the gravitational force on an object, equals mass times local gravitational acceleration, approximately 9.8 meters per second squared on Earth's surface.

Friction opposes relative motion between surfaces, proportional to the normal force through a coefficient dependent on surface properties. Friction manifests in static, kinetic, and rolling forms, each with distinct characteristics.

Circular motion requires centripetal force directed toward the center of curvature, proportional to mass and the square of velocity, inversely proportional to radius. This inward force maintains curved trajectories, while centripetal acceleration describes the continuous direction change inherent in circular paths.

ENERGY AND WORK

Work represents energy transfer through force applied over displacement, calculated as the dot product of force and displacement vectors. Kinetic energy, energy of motion, equals half mass times velocity squared. Gravitational potential energy represents stored energy due to position in a gravitational field, proportional to mass, gravitational acceleration, and height above a reference point.

The work-energy theorem establishes that net work equals the change in kinetic energy, providing a powerful tool for analyzing motion without detailed force analysis. Conservation of mechanical energy states that in isolated systems without friction, the sum of kinetic and potential energy remains constant, enabling energy transformation calculations.

Power measures the rate of energy transfer or work performance, calculated as work divided by time or as the product of force and velocity. Elastic potential energy, stored in deformed springs or elastic materials, equals half the spring constant times displacement squared, following Hooke's law.

ROTATIONAL MECHANICS

Torque, the rotational analog of force, equals the cross product of lever arm and force, causing rotational motion about an axis. Moment of inertia, the rotational analog of mass, depends on both mass and its distribution relative to the rotation axis. Angular momentum, the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity, is conserved in systems without external torque.

Rotational kinetic energy equals half the moment of inertia times angular velocity squared. The relationship between torque, moment of inertia, and angular acceleration mirrors Newton's second law in rotational form, providing the foundation for analyzing rotating systems.

THERMODYNAMICS

Temperature represents the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance, related to particle motion at the microscopic scale. Absolute zero corresponds to zero particle kinetic energy. Heat represents thermal energy transfer due to temperature differences, flowing spontaneously from hot to cold through conduction, convection, or radiation.

The first law of thermodynamics establishes energy conservation, stating that the change in internal energy equals heat added minus work done by the system. This fundamental principle connects thermal and mechanical energy.

The second law introduces entropy, asserting that entropy increases in isolated systems, establishing an arrow of time and the irreversibility of natural processes. Entropy change equals heat transfer divided by temperature for reversible processes, with actual processes generating additional entropy.

The ideal gas law relates pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas through the universal gas constant, providing an excellent approximation for many real gases under typical conditions. Heat capacity quantifies the heat required to change temperature, specified per unit mass or per mole.

The Carnot efficiency establishes the theoretical maximum efficiency for heat engines operating between two temperature reservoirs, dependent only on reservoir temperatures. This fundamental limit constrains all real engines. Statistical mechanics defines entropy in terms of the number of microstates, connecting thermodynamics to probability and disorder.

ELECTROSTATICS

Coulomb's law describes the electric force between charges, proportional to the product of charges and inversely proportional to the square of separation, analogous to gravitational attraction but with both attractive and repulsive forms.

Electric field represents force per unit charge, a vector field created by source charges that determines forces on test charges. Electric potential describes energy per unit charge, a scalar field whose gradient determines the electric field.

ELECTRIC CIRCUITS

Ohm's law establishes the linear relationship between voltage, current, and resistance for ohmic materials, fundamental to circuit analysis. Electric power in circuits equals voltage times current, with alternative forms using resistance.

Kirchhoff's current law expresses charge conservation at circuit junctions, stating that current entering equals current leaving. Kirchhoff's voltage law expresses energy conservation around closed loops, requiring that voltage rises equal voltage drops.

Resistors in series add directly, sharing current. Resistors in parallel add reciprocally, sharing voltage and providing lower total resistance. Capacitors combine oppositely - in series they add reciprocally, in parallel they add directly.

MAGNETISM

Magnetic force on moving charges equals charge times velocity cross product with magnetic field, perpendicular to both velocity and field. Current-carrying wires experience force proportional to current, wire length, and magnetic field.

The Biot-Savart law calculates magnetic fields from current distributions, fundamental to magnetostatics. Ampere's law relates the line integral of magnetic field around closed paths to enclosed current, a Maxwell equation providing powerful calculation techniques.

Faraday's law of induction states that changing magnetic flux induces electromotive force, the basis for generators and transformers. The induced emf equals the negative time derivative of magnetic flux, with the negative sign representing Lenz's law - induced effects oppose their cause.

Magnetic flux equals the dot product of magnetic field and area. Inductance measures magnetic flux per unit current, with self-inductance describing a circuit's opposition to current changes through its own magnetic field.

Energy stored in inductors equals half inductance times current squared, representing magnetic field energy. RC circuits charge exponentially with time constant equal to resistance times capacitance. RL circuits establish current exponentially with time constant equal to inductance divided by resistance. LC circuits oscillate at a resonant frequency determined by inductance and capacitance.

WAVES AND OPTICS

Wave velocity equals frequency times wavelength, a universal relationship for all wave types. The speed of light in vacuum represents a fundamental constant, approximately 300,000,000 meters per second, and the maximum speed for information transfer.

Electromagnetic waves propagate at light speed, with speed related to electric permittivity and magnetic permeability through Maxwell's equations. Snell's law describes refraction at media boundaries, relating angles to refractive indices. The law of reflection states that incident and reflected angles equal, measured from the surface normal.

The thin lens equation relates focal length to object and image distances, enabling image position calculations. Magnification equals image height divided by object height, or negative image distance divided by object distance.

Interference occurs when waves superpose. Constructive interference, producing maximum intensity, requires path differences of integer wavelengths. Destructive interference, producing minimum intensity, requires path differences of half-integer wavelengths.

Single-slit diffraction produces dark fringes when slit width times sine of angle equals integer multiples of wavelength. The Doppler effect shifts frequency for moving sources, producing redshift for receding sources and blueshift for approaching sources.
