# Agent Notes (Project Scope)

## Local workflow constraints

- Do not run `git` commands (e.g. `git status`, `git diff`, `git checkout`, `git restore`) unless the user explicitly asks; the user may have multiple concurrent sessions and relies on their own git workflow.

## Output language

- All user-facing CLI output and generated report text must be in English, even if the user provides instructions in Romanian.
