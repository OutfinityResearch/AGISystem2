# Everyday State / Property Tokens (tests/evals convenience)
# These tokens and mutual-exclusivity constraints are useful for toy worlds and eval suites,
# but they are not required for baseline consistency schemas.

@Open:Open __State  # Provide an everyday state token for toy-world modeling.
@Closed:Closed __State  # Provide an everyday state token for toy-world modeling.
@Alive:Alive __State  # Provide an everyday state token for toy-world modeling.
@Dead:Dead __State  # Provide an everyday state token for toy-world modeling.
@PoweredOn:PoweredOn __State  # Provide an everyday state token for toy-world modeling.
@PoweredOff:PoweredOff __State  # Provide an everyday state token for toy-world modeling.
@Full:Full __State  # Provide an everyday state token for toy-world modeling.
@Empty:Empty __State  # Provide an everyday state token for toy-world modeling.

@Hot:Hot __Property  # Provide an everyday property token for toy-world modeling.
@Cold:Cold __Property  # Provide an everyday property token for toy-world modeling.
@Wet:Wet __Property  # Provide an everyday property token for toy-world modeling.
@Dry:Dry __Property  # Provide an everyday property token for toy-world modeling.
