# tests_and_evals - Theory Pack Index
# Non-minimal, eval-driven, and convenience vocabulary that should not be part of the baseline packs.
#
# Policy:
# - Baseline packs should remain domain-agnostic and small.
# - This pack groups anything that exists mainly because tests/evals/UI need it today.
# - We will likely split this pack later into evalSuite/domain-specific packs.
