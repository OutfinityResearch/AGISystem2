Whitney is not precious. Jack is not supportive. Joseph is not reasonable. Christina is not oval. Barry is not broad-minded.If Whitney is not reasonable, then Wade is broad-minded. If Terry is supportive and Christina is broad-minded, then Wade is not oval. Wade being not precious and Wade being mushy imply that Joseph is not supportive. If there is at least one people who is broad-minded or not supportive, then Christina is precious. If Jack is mushy, then Jack is not precious and Wade is not reasonable, and vice versa. Someone who is broad-minded is always both oval and not supportive. As long as someone is not mushy, he is supportive and not broad-minded. If there is someone who is neither oval nor supportive, then Christina is not reasonable. If someone is not oval, then he is neither reasonable nor broad-minded. Someone being not reasonable is equivalent to being oval. As long as someone is not reasonable, he is oval and not supportive. Someone being oval is equivalent to being not precious. statement: Barry is reasonable.",
