Algernon is shiny. Howard is soft. Cara is shiny. Cara is granite.Algernon is not cheap if and only if Howard is not comfortable. Someone is cheap and comfortable if and only if he is soft. Someone who is comfortable or new is always not cheap and not granite. As long as someone is soft, he is comfortable and cheap. Cara is shiny if and only if Cara is not new and Cara is comfortable. If Christopher is not soft, then Graciela is not comfortable and Graciela is cheap, and vice versa. Someone being neither new nor soft is equivalent to being shiny and comfortable. If there is someone who is soft, then Howard is new. It can be concluded that Howard is not soft and Christopher is new once knowing that Howard is shiny. If Graciela is cheap and Christopher is not soft, then Cara is not new. Graciela being not new is equivalent to Howard being not granite. If there is at least one people who is both soft and not comfortable, then Blaine is granite. statement: Luka is comfortable.",
