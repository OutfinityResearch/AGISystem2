  <p>AGISystem2 is best when correctness and accountability trump eloquence. If your domain has rules and exceptions that you must honor—compliance workflows, safety envelopes, expert systems, narrative continuity, grounded RAG—this engine is a good fit. Its determinism and explicit geometry make it reliable as both a guardian and a collaborator.</p>
  <p>As a guardian, the engine checks facts against theory stacks, flags conflicts, and refuses to smooth over contradictions. In healthcare, it can enforce consent and audit-trail requirements and surface clashes between GDPR and HIPAA instead of guessing. In industrial control, it can detect when sensor states leave the safe diamond and explain which dimensions violated bounds. As a co-author alongside a generative agent, it keeps story logic straight: characters stay coherent across chapters, cities obey their rules (tech-based “magic” instead of literal magic in a sci-fi setting), and foreshadowed events require payoffs.</p>
  <p>Developers usually work in two tempos. During fast feedback, they use auto_test or manual_test profiles and run the documented suites to exercise real modules end-to-end. For embedded deployments, they expose EngineAPI or the narrower getAgenticSession to agents that speak the constrained grammar. In both tempos, provenance makes debugging humane: you can rerun a scenario and get the same answer with a trail of layers, masks, and distances.</p>
  <p>When integrating with LLMs, treat AGISystem2 as the arbiter. Validate retrieved facts before passing them to the LLM; after the LLM responds, feed its claims back as questions and reject anything that fails inclusion or collides with active layers. For expert systems, encode exceptions as separate theory layers and let ValidationEngine police consistency. For compliance bots, make theory precedence explicit and keep axiology masks ready for audits and veil-of-ignorance checks.</p>
  <p>The practical takeaway is simple: use AGISystem2 to enforce the non-negotiable structure of your domain, and pair it with generative tools only where creativity is needed. Its strengths are reproducibility, traceability, and the ability to say “I don’t know” when the geometry says so.</p>
