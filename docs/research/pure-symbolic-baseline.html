      <small>Design idea: a separate term engine (kept exploratory)</small>
    </div>

    <p>
      A recurring research question is: what does HDC add beyond a strong symbolic baseline? One possible answer is to build a separate “pure term
      engine” backend (unification + backtracking) that runs Sys2DSL without vectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      In practice, AGISystem2 already contains substantial symbolic machinery (direct matches, rules, transitive reasoning, CSP, proof validation),
      and a fully separate backend would create a large maintenance burden (semantic drift, proof formatting parity, graph/macro parity).
      Because of this, the “pure term engine backend” remains a research reference, not an implementation plan.
    </p>

    <h2>Spec</h2>

      <a href="../specsLoader.html?spec=DS/DS24-Pure-Symbolic-Term-Engine-EXPLORATORY.md">DS24 – Pure Symbolic Term Engine (Exploratory)</a>
      captures the design motivation and what a full backend would look like.
    </p>

    <h2>Preferred baseline approach</h2>
    <p>
      When we need a “pure symbolic” comparison for performance, the preferred approach is to add a symbolic-only profile to the existing engine
      (disable holographic candidate generation) rather than introducing a new backend.
