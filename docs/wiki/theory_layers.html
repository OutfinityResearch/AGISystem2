      <h2>Philosophical Foundations of Layered Knowledge</h2>
      <p>Theory layers represent a sophisticated approach to knowledge representation that recognizes human understanding operates at multiple levels of abstraction and context-dependence. This concept reflects the fundamental insight that knowledge is not monolithic but is organized into strata, where each layer provides different perspectives, assumptions, or purposes for the same underlying reality. The philosophical significance lies in its ability to model how humans maintain multiple, potentially contradictory frameworks of understanding and navigate between them based on context and purpose.</p>
      
      <p>The idea of layered knowledge has deep roots in epistemology and psychology. It reflects the recognition that human reasoning involves not just applying fixed rules but dynamically shifting between different modes of understanding—scientific, intuitive, ethical, or practical. Each mode has its own assumptions, its own criteria of evidence, and its own methods of inference. The ability to maintain and navigate between these layers is a hallmark of sophisticated intelligence and adaptability.</p>
      
      <p>From a philosophical perspective, theory layers also address the problem of context-dependence and relativism in human reasoning. By making the layering explicit, we can recognize that what counts as rational or appropriate behavior depends heavily on context, goals, and assumptions. This insight has profound implications for understanding cultural differences, scientific revolutions, and moral reasoning across different situations.</p>

      <h2>Layered Architecture in AGISystem2</h2>
      <p>In AGISystem2, theory layers are implemented through a comprehensive framework that enables sophisticated knowledge management, context switching, and meta-reasoning. The system treats layers not as simple overlays but as fundamental structural components that can be composed, prioritized, and dynamically managed. This implementation provides the flexibility to handle complex reasoning scenarios while maintaining logical consistency and auditability.</p>
      
      <p>TheoryStack component serves as the central mechanism for managing multiple knowledge layers simultaneously. Each layer can contain concepts, relations, and axiological principles that represent a particular worldview, context, or set of assumptions. The stack maintains ordering and priority relationships between layers, enabling sophisticated conflict resolution and context-appropriate reasoning. Layers can be pushed, popped, or temporarily modified to support different reasoning modes.</p>
      
      <p>Layer composition allows for building complex knowledge structures by combining simpler layers. The system can merge layers to create more comprehensive worldviews, intersect them to identify commonalities, or subtract them to isolate differences. This compositional capability enables the system to build up complex understanding from foundational principles while maintaining traceability of how knowledge was constructed.</p>
      
      <p>Contextual layer switching enables the system to adapt its reasoning to different situations or requirements. The system can automatically select appropriate layers based on factors such as domain, user preferences, or regulatory constraints. This switching is not merely toggling between pre-defined states but can involve dynamic layer creation or modification based on current context.</p>

      <h2>Advanced Layering Capabilities</h2>
      <p>The theory layering system in AGISystem2 includes several advanced features that enable sophisticated knowledge management and reasoning. These capabilities extend beyond simple knowledge storage to support the full complexity of human-like understanding and adaptation.</p>
      
      <p>Temporal layering allows the system to maintain different versions of knowledge across time while preserving the ability to reason about historical states and alternative futures. The system can create temporal layers that represent knowledge at different time points, enabling reasoning about change, causation, and prediction. This temporal capability is essential for learning from experience and planning for future contingencies.</p>
      
      <p>Hypothetical layering supports counterfactual reasoning by allowing the system to explore alternative scenarios without committing to permanent knowledge changes. The system can create temporary layers that represent "what if" scenarios, enabling safe exploration of possibilities and evaluation of their consequences. This capability is crucial for decision support, policy analysis, and creative problem-solving.</p>
      
      <p>Meta-layering enables the system to reason about the layering structure itself, supporting reflection and self-improvement. The system can create layers that contain metadata about other layers, rules for layer composition, or constraints on layer usage. This meta-reasoning capability allows the system to understand and modify its own knowledge organization, supporting autonomous learning and adaptation.</p>

      <h2>Implications for Contextual Reasoning and Adaptability</h2>
      <p>The implementation of theory layers in AGISystem2 has profound implications for how artificial intelligence systems can achieve human-like flexibility and context-sensitivity. By maintaining multiple simultaneous perspectives on reality, the system can engage in sophisticated reasoning that adapts to different situations while maintaining logical consistency within each perspective.</p>
      
      <p>From a cognitive science perspective, this approach mirrors how humans maintain multiple mental models and switch between them based on context. The ability to hold contradictory beliefs in different contexts and apply them appropriately is a hallmark of human intelligence. The layering system enables AI to achieve similar flexibility without the paradoxes that might arise from trying to maintain a single consistent worldview.</p>
      
      <p>The explicit layering also enhances the system's ability to engage in meta-reasoning and self-reflection. By making the structure of knowledge an object of reasoning itself, the system can examine its own assumptions, recognize their limitations, and improve its knowledge organization. This capability is essential for building AI systems that can learn and adapt autonomously.</p>

      <h2>Academic Context and Related Work</h2>
      <p>The concept of layered knowledge has been extensively studied in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and philosophy. Key contributors include Marvin Minsky, who developed the idea of mental models and frames; Daniel Dennett, who explored multiple drafts and consciousness; and numerous researchers in knowledge representation who have developed formal systems for managing contextual and hierarchical knowledge.</p>
      
      <p>In artificial intelligence, layered architectures have been applied to expert systems, natural language understanding, and context-aware computing. The ability to maintain and switch between different knowledge representations is particularly valuable for building systems that can adapt to different users, domains, or cultural contexts.</p>
