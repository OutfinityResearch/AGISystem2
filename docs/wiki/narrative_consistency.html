    <h2>The Nature of Narrative Consistency</h2>
    <p>
      Narrative consistency is the property of a story whose events, characters and explanations fit together
      in a way that feels coherent, intelligible and stable over time. A consistent narrative is not merely a
      list of facts; it is an ordered structure in which earlier statements constrain what can be said later,
      and in which causal and temporal relations are respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philosophers of history and literature have long noted that humans understand the world through narratives:
      we track who did what, when, for which reasons, and with what consequences. In this view, inconsistency is
      not only a logical defect (holding incompatible propositions) but also a narrative defect: the storyline
      fractures, characters behave inexplicably, or events appear without plausible antecedents. For a reasoning
      system that interacts with humans, maintaining narrative consistency is therefore a core dimension of
      intelligibility and trust.
    </p>

    <h2>Narrative Consistency in Artificial Reasoning</h2>
    <p>
      In traditional knowledge-based systems, consistency is often treated purely as a logical property: the
      knowledge base must avoid explicit contradictions. However, narrative consistency requires more than
      logical satisfiability. A system may avoid direct contradictions while still producing answers that jump
      across time, ignore earlier context, or silently change the underlying assumptions of a scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern AI applications, especially those used in law, medicine, compliance, and operations, must give
      answers that respect a temporal and causal storyline. If a system says that a patient received a treatment,
      it should not later act as if the treatment never happened; if a legal reasoning chain assumes a specific
      contract clause, later steps should not switch to a different clause without explicit acknowledgement.
      Narrative consistency ensures that the system’s explanations behave more like a careful human expert than
      like a sequence of isolated predictions.
    </p>

    <h2>Narrative Consistency in AGISystem2</h2>
    <p>
      AGISystem2 treats narrative consistency as an explicit design goal that spans its geometric representation,
      theory layering, and reasoning pipeline. Instead of producing answers in isolation, the system operates
      within theory contexts and temporal traces that encode “what the story is so far”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several components contribute to this behaviour:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Temporal Memory.</strong> Temporal memory maintains chronologies of events, states and transitions.
        It allows the system to interpret a sequence of facts as a timeline, not just as a set, so that queries
        can be evaluated relative to earlier and later states. This supports questions like “Was the policy in
        force at the time of this decision?” or “What changed between these two consultations?”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Reasoner and Theory Stack.</strong> The Reasoner assembles concepts and relations from the
        active theory stack, ensuring that conclusions follow from a consistent set of assumptions. When multiple
        theories (for example, conflicting guidelines or alternative scenarios) are active, the meta-rational
        stack keeps track of which narrative branch each answer belongs to, instead of silently mixing them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sys2DSL and explicit scenarios.</strong> Through Sys2DSL scripts, authors can describe scenarios
        as sequences of facts, counterfactuals and queries. Topological evaluation ensures that dependencies
        between variables and steps are respected, while theory overlays and counterfactual layers allow the
        system to explore “what if” narratives without corrupting the baseline storyline.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Validation and audit.</strong> Validation components can re-run reasoning under controlled
        conditions to check that explanations remain stable when inputs and theory contexts are unchanged.
        Audit logs capture which theories, dimensions and masks influenced each answer, making it possible to
        reconstruct the narrative path that led to a given conclusion.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Together, these mechanisms ensure that AGISystem2 is not just answering isolated questions, but maintaining
      coherent stories about the domains in which it operates.
    </p>

    <h2>Implications and Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
      Narrative consistency has important practical implications. In compliance and governance scenarios, it
      supports the reconstruction of decisions as complete stories: which facts were known, which rules applied,
      which exceptions were considered, and why a particular outcome was chosen. In medicine, it underpins
      longitudinal patient narratives, where each new observation must integrate with an existing clinical story.
    </p>
    <p>
      For users, narrative consistency is also a key ingredient of trust. A system that changes its explanations
      every time it is queried, or that forgets earlier commitments, quickly loses credibility. By design,
      AGISystem2 aims to make such failures visible: when theory changes or contradictions prevent a stable
      narrative, the system prefers to surface the conflict rather than fabricate a smooth but inconsistent story.
    </p>

    <h2>Academic References</h2>
    <p>
      The importance of narrative coherence has been discussed in philosophy of history, literary theory and
      cognitive science. Paul Ricoeur’s work on time and narrative examines how temporal ordering and plot
      structure contribute to understanding. In AI, research on story generation, plan recognition and case-based
      reasoning has explored how systems can maintain coherent sequences of events and explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      For broader background, standard references on narrative theory and discourse structure provide useful
      context for how humans assess coherence and plausibility in stories.
    </p>
