  <p>Deontic logic studies permissions, obligations and prohibitions; in AGISystem2 these ideas live on dedicated value dimensions and are manipulated through deontic relations that mark actions as allowed, required or forbidden in a given context.</p>
  
  <h2>In AGISystem2</h2>
  <p>The system implements deontic reasoning through specialized dimensions and relations in the vector space. This allows for the representation and manipulation of normative concepts like permissions, obligations, and prohibitions.</p>
  
  <p>Key deontic concepts include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Deontic dimensions</strong> - Specific axes that encode normative information</li>
    <li><strong>Obligation bands</strong> - Regions representing required actions or states</li>
    <li><strong>Permission bands</strong> - Regions representing allowed actions or states</li>
    <li><strong>Prohibition bands</strong> - Regions representing forbidden actions or states</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>Deontic reasoning is implemented through the Reasoner module, which can evaluate statements against deontic criteria and generate explanations for normative decisions. The system uses geometric operations to determine whether actions fall within permitted, obligated, or forbidden regions of the conceptual space.</p>
