  <p>The symbol-grounding problem asks how abstract symbols obtain meaning in relation to the world; AGISystem2 approaches grounding by tying symbolic statements to geometric regions whose dimensions correspond to interpretable empirical and normative quantities.</p>
  
  <h2>In AGISystem2</h2>
  <p>The system addresses the symbol grounding problem by ensuring that all symbolic representations are tied to concrete geometric structures with interpretable dimensions.</p>
  
  <p>Key grounding approaches:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dimensional grounding</strong> - Each dimension corresponds to an interpretable quantity</li>
    <li><strong>Geometric meaning</strong> - Symbols are grounded in spatial relationships</li>
    <li><strong>Empirical connection</strong> - Dimensions are tied to measurable properties</li>
    <li><strong>Normative anchoring</strong> - Value dimensions are grounded in ethical frameworks</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>Symbol grounding is implemented through the VectorSpace module, which maintains the mapping between symbolic representations and geometric structures. The system ensures that all operations have clear geometric interpretations, preventing the creation of ungrounded or meaningless symbols.</p>
