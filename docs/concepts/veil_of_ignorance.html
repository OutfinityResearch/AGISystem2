  <p>The veil of ignorance is a thought experiment from political philosophy where decisions are made without knowing one's own position; BiasController implements analogous modes by masking protected attributes during reasoning.</p>
  
  <h2>In AGISystem2</h2>
  <p>The system implements veil of ignorance reasoning through the BiasController, which can temporarily mask protected attributes to ensure fair and unbiased decision-making.</p>
  
  <p>Key veil of ignorance features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Attribute masking</strong> - Hiding protected characteristics during reasoning</li>
    <li><strong>Fair decision making</strong> - Ensuring decisions don't depend on protected attributes</li>
    <li><strong>Impartial reasoning</strong> - Making decisions as if one's own position is unknown</li>
    <li><strong>Ethical alignment</strong> - Promoting fairness and equality in decision processes</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>The veil of ignorance is implemented through the BiasController's masking capabilities. The system can apply temporary filters that hide specific dimensions (corresponding to protected attributes) during reasoning, ensuring that decisions are made without knowledge of sensitive characteristics.</p>
