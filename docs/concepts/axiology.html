  <p>Axiology is the study of values and value judgements; in this project it names the part of the vector space reserved for norms, preferences, permissions and obligations, separated from factual content.</p>
  
  <h2>In AGISystem2</h2>
  <p>The engine implements axiological reasoning through dedicated dimensions in the vector space that carry evaluative and normative information. These axiology dimensions are kept separate from ontology dimensions (which carry factual content) to ensure that value judgements never corrupt factual representations and vice versa.</p>
  
  <p>Key axiological concepts in the system include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Value dimensions</strong> - Specific axes in the vector space that encode preferences, utilities, and normative stances</li>
    <li><strong>Deontic bands</strong> - Regions that represent permissions, obligations, and prohibitions</li>
    <li><strong>Value-sensitive retrieval</strong> - The ability to filter and rank results based on axiological criteria</li>
    <li><strong>Bias control</strong> - Mechanisms to ensure value judgements are applied consistently and transparently</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>Axiological reasoning is implemented through the BiasController module, which manages masks and overlays that can temporarily emphasize or de-emphasize certain value dimensions without altering the underlying factual representations. This allows the system to simulate different ethical frameworks or cultural viewpoints while maintaining the integrity of the core knowledge base.</p>
