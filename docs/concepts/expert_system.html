  <p>An expert system is a program that encodes specialist knowledge in a structured way to answer questions; AGISystem2's expert mode is a modern variant that uses geometric regions and theory layers instead of only symbolic rules.</p>
  
  <h2>In AGISystem2</h2>
  <p>The system provides an expert mode that combines traditional expert system capabilities with the power of geometric reasoning. This allows for more nuanced and flexible knowledge representation than purely symbolic approaches.</p>
  
  <p>Key expert system features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Knowledge encoding</strong> - Representing expert knowledge as geometric regions</li>
    <li><strong>Rule application</strong> - Using geometric operations to apply expert rules</li>
    <li><strong>Explanation generation</strong> - Providing detailed explanations for expert decisions</li>
    <li><strong>Uncertainty handling</strong> - Managing degrees of certainty through geometric boundaries</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>The expert mode is implemented through the API module, which provides interfaces for creating and managing expert knowledge bases. The system uses the VectorSpace and Reasoner modules to apply expert knowledge and generate explanations for decisions.</p>
