  <p>Conceptual spaces treat meaning as geometry: entities are points and concepts are regions in a space of interpretable dimensions; AGISystem2 realises this with bounded diamonds and relevance masks.</p>
  
  <h2>In AGISystem2</h2>
  <p>The system implements conceptual spaces theory by representing knowledge as geometric structures in a high-dimensional vector space. Each dimension corresponds to an interpretable feature, and concepts are defined as regions within this space.</p>
  
  <p>Key conceptual space components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bounded diamonds</strong> - Geometric regions that represent concepts with clear boundaries</li>
    <li><strong>Relevance masks</strong> - Filters that determine which dimensions are relevant for specific reasoning tasks</li>
    <li><strong>Vector space</strong> - The high-dimensional space where all reasoning takes place</li>
    <li><strong>Distance metrics</strong> - Measures of similarity and difference between concepts</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>The VectorSpace module manages the conceptual space, providing operations for creating, manipulating, and querying geometric regions. The MathEngine handles distance computations and geometric transformations, while the ConceptStore manages the persistence and retrieval of concept definitions.</p>
