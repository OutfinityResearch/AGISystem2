  <p>Ontology in philosophy is the study of what exists; here it designates the part of the vector space that encodes factual structure about entities, properties and relations, kept distinct from evaluative or normative information.</p>
  
  <h2>In AGISystem2</h2>
  <p>The system maintains a clear separation between ontological (factual) and axiological (value-based) dimensions in the vector space. This separation ensures that factual representations remain pure and uncontaminated by value judgements.</p>
  <p>Key ontological concepts include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ontology dimensions</strong> - Axes that encode factual information about the world</li>
    <li><strong>Entity representation</strong> - How entities are encoded as points in the space</li>
    <li><strong>Property encoding</strong> - How properties and attributes are represented</li>
    <li><strong>Relational structure</strong> - How relationships between entities are encoded</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>Ontological reasoning is managed through the VectorSpace module, which provides operations for creating and manipulating factual representations. The system uses geometric operations to reason about entities, properties, and their relationships while maintaining the separation from value-based dimensions.</p>
