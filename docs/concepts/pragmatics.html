  <p>Pragmatics studies how context and purpose influence meaning beyond literal content; the project uses this notion when discussing deployment scenarios, safety constraints and how answers are framed for users.</p>
  
  <h2>In AGISystem2</h2>
  <p>The system incorporates pragmatic considerations into its reasoning processes, ensuring that outputs are appropriate for their intended context and audience.</p>
  
  <p>Key pragmatic considerations include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Context awareness</strong> - Understanding the situational context of reasoning</li>
    <li><strong>User adaptation</strong> - Tailoring responses to user needs and expertise</li>
    <li><strong>Safety constraints</strong> - Ensuring outputs meet safety requirements</li>
    <li><strong>Practical utility</strong> - Focusing on actionable and useful results</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>Pragmatic reasoning is implemented through the BiasController and configuration system, which allow the system to adapt its reasoning based on context and user requirements. The system can apply different masks and filters to ensure outputs are appropriate for their intended use.</p>
