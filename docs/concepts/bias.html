    <h1>Bias</h1>

  <p>Bias denotes systematic distortion in decisions or representations; here it covers both unfair dependence on protected attributes and more general value-laden shortcuts that the engine makes explicit through masks and partitions.</p>
  
  <h2>In AGISystem2</h2>
  <p>The system treats bias as a first-class concept that must be made explicit and manageable. Rather than trying to eliminate bias entirely (which is impossible), the system provides tools to identify, measure, and control bias in reasoning processes.</p>
  
  <p>Key bias-related concepts include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>BiasController</strong> - Module that manages bias detection and mitigation</li>
    <li><strong>Protected attributes</strong> - Dimensions that require special handling to prevent discrimination</li>
    <li><strong>Value masks</strong> - Overlays that can emphasize or de-emphasize certain dimensions</li>
    <li><strong>Adversarial bands</strong> - Regions that help identify and quantify bias in decisions</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>The BiasController implements bias management through geometric operations on the vector space. It can apply masks that temporarily hide or emphasize certain dimensions, simulate different viewpoints, and generate explanations for how bias affects reasoning outcomes.</p>
