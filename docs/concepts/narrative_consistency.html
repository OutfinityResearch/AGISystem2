    <h1>Narrative Consistency</h1>

  <p>Narrative consistency refers to the way events, actions and explanations hang together as a coherent story; the engine and its tests use this notion when checking whether sequences of states and decisions remain logically and temporally aligned.</p>
  
  <h2>In AGISystem2</h2>
  <p>The system provides tools for ensuring narrative consistency in complex reasoning scenarios. This is particularly important for applications involving temporal reasoning, story understanding, and multi-step decision making.</p>
  
  <p>Key narrative consistency features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Temporal tracking</strong> - Maintaining consistency across time steps</li>
    <li><strong>State validation</strong> - Ensuring states transition logically</li>
    <li><strong>Explanation coherence</strong> - Checking that explanations form consistent narratives</li>
    <li><strong>Conflict detection</strong> - Identifying inconsistencies in reasoning chains</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>Narrative consistency is implemented through the TemporalMemory module, which tracks state changes over time, and the ValidationEngine, which checks for logical and temporal consistency. The system uses geometric operations to verify that sequences of states form coherent narratives.</p>
