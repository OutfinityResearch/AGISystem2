  <p>Abduction, or inference to the best explanation, is the reasoning style that starts from an observation and searches for the most plausible cause; the engine realises it by inverting relational permutations and retrieving concepts that best account for the observed vector.</p>
  
  <h2>In AGISystem2</h2>
  <p>Abductive reasoning is implemented as a geometric operation in the conceptual space. Given an observation represented as a vector, the system searches for concepts and relations that, when applied, would most likely produce the observed state.</p>
  
  <p>The abductive process involves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Observation encoding</strong> - Converting the observed state into a vector representation</li>
    <li><strong>Relation inversion</strong> - Working backwards through known relations to find potential causes</li>
    <li><strong>Concept retrieval</strong> - Finding concepts that best explain the observation</li>
    <li><strong>Plausibility scoring</strong> - Ranking explanations based on geometric distance and coherence</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>The Reasoner module implements abduction through the `abduce` method, which uses the MathEngine to compute inverse transformations and the Retriever to find candidate explanations. The process leverages the vector space's geometric properties to ensure that explanations are both plausible and computationally tractable.</p>
