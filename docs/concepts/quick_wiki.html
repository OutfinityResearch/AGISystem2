  <p>This page is a compact index of the main philosophical and technical notions that appear throughout the documentation. It is designed for programmers who may not have formal training in philosophy or machine learning theory but want to understand the vocabulary of the engine. The first table focuses on philosophical and meta-cognitive ideas; the second collects more technical algorithms and architectural concepts.</p>

      <td><a href="bias.html">Bias</a></td>
      <td>Bias denotes systematic distortion in decisions or representations; here it covers both unfair dependence on protected attributes and more general value-laden shortcuts that the engine makes explicit through masks and partitions.</td>

      <td><a href="conceptual_spaces.html">Conceptual spaces</a></td>
      <td>Conceptual spaces treat meaning as geometry: entities are points and concepts are regions in a space of interpretable dimensions; AGISystem2 realises this with bounded diamonds and relevance masks.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><a href="counterfactual.html">Counterfactual</a></td>
      <td>A counterfactual is a statement about what would happen in a world that differs from the actual one; the engine models such worlds as temporary theory layers that alter parts of the conceptual space without rewriting stored facts.</td>

      <td><a href="deontic_logic.html">Deontic logic</a></td>
      <td>Deontic logic studies permissions, obligations and prohibitions; in AGISystem2 these ideas live on dedicated value dimensions and are manipulated through deontic relations that mark actions as allowed, required or forbidden in a given context.</td>

      <td><a href="expert_system.html">Expert system</a></td>
      <td>An expert system is a program that encodes specialist knowledge in a structured way to answer questions; AGISystem2’s expert mode is a modern variant that uses geometric regions and theory layers instead of only symbolic rules.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><a href="ontology.html">Ontology</a></td>
      <td>Ontology in philosophy is the study of what exists; here it designates the part of the vector space that encodes factual structure about entities, properties and relations, kept distinct from evaluative or normative information.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><a href="abduction.html">Abduction</a></td>
      <td>Abduction, or inference to the best explanation, is the reasoning style that starts from an observation and searches for the most plausible cause; the engine realises it by inverting relational permutations and retrieving concepts that best account for the observed vector.</td>

      <td><a href="analogy.html">Analogy</a></td>
      <td>Analogy compares structured situations of the form “A is to B as C is to D”; AGISystem2 models this by translating vectors in conceptual space so that the relation between C and a candidate D mirrors the relation between A and B.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><a href="narrative_consistency.html">Narrative consistency</a></td>
      <td>Narrative consistency refers to the way events, actions and explanations hang together as a coherent story; the engine and its tests use this notion when checking whether sequences of states and decisions remain logically and temporally aligned.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><a href="non_monotonic_logic.html">Non-monotonic logic</a></td>
      <td>Non-monotonic logic allows conclusions to be withdrawn when new information arrives; AGISystem2 supports this behaviour through layers and overrides that can retract default inferences without rewriting the entire knowledge base.</td>

      <td><a href="symbol_grounding.html">Symbol grounding</a></td>
      <td>The symbol-grounding problem asks how abstract symbols obtain meaning in relation to the world; AGISystem2 approaches grounding by tying symbolic statements to geometric regions whose dimensions correspond to interpretable empirical and normative quantities.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><a href="trustworthy_ai.html">Trustworthy AI</a></td>
      <td>Trustworthy AI is an umbrella term for systems that are reliable, transparent and aligned with human values; this project contributes by making reasoning deterministic, geometrically interpretable and auditable through explicit bias and validation mechanisms.</td>

      <td><a href="veil_of_ignorance.html">Veil of ignorance</a></td>
      <td>The veil of ignorance is a thought experiment from political philosophy where decisions are made without knowing one’s own position; BiasController implements analogous modes by masking protected attributes during reasoning.</td>

      <td><a href="hyperdimensional_computing.html">Hyperdimensional computing</a></td>
      <td>Hyperdimensional computing uses very high-dimensional vectors and simple operations like addition and permutation to represent complex structures; AGISystem2 adopts this style for encoding, superposition and temporal rotation.</td>

      <td>Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)</td>
      <td>LSH is used as a fast, approximate neighbour search: hash families and banding group nearby vectors so Retriever can propose candidate concepts before exact masked L1 distances are computed by MathEngine.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Permutation-based binding</td>
      <td>Permutation-based binding encodes structure by shuffling indices according to a relation-specific table before adding vectors, so that roles like subject, object or cause are distinguishable without increasing dimensionality.</td>
      <td>See binding in vector symbolic architectures and hyperdimensional computing surveys.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>L1 vs L2 distance</td>
      <td>The engine relies on masked L1 distance rather than L2 because in high dimensions L1 tends to preserve contrast between near and far points better, making the boundaries of bounded diamonds more meaningful.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Superposition</td>
      <td>Superposition adds multiple high-dimensional vectors together so that consistent features reinforce and noise cancels; AGISystem2 uses it to build and update concept prototypes over time.</td>
      <td>Discussed in hyperdimensional computing and holographic reduced representations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Adversarial bands</td>
      <td>Adversarial bands grade truth by two radii: an inner sceptic radius for robust True, an outer optimist radius for Plausible, with points beyond treated as False; they make thresholds explicit and auditable.</td>
      <td>Engineering pattern inspired by robust decision margins in machine learning.</td>
