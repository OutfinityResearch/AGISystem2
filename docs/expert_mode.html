  <p>AGISystem2 deliberately stands in the tradition of expert systems from the 1980s: programs that capture specialist knowledge so that non-experts can obtain consistent, justifiable answers. Classic expert systems encoded hundreds or thousands of IF/THEN rules in handwritten knowledge bases. They offered traceability but were often brittle, hard to extend, and slow to maintain because each new exception required touching many rules. Expert System Mode keeps the spirit of those systems—transparent reasoning with a clear audit trail—but replaces fragile rule chains with geometric regions and layered overrides. Rules become shapes; exceptions become overlays; the underlying machinery is vector arithmetic rather than ad-hoc control flow.</p>

  <p>In this setting, a domain expert does not manage a tangle of rules but curates concepts and layers. To build an expert system, you begin with a base ontology and axiology that describe the stable structure and values of the domain, much like a carefully designed rule base in the older systems. You then add domain theories as separate layers: civil law, war law, maritime rules, corporate policies, safety envelopes. Exceptions are expressed as new layers, not edits to the base. Precedence is explicit; the order of the stack determines which overrides apply. Facts and rules enter through the constrained grammar; if the source text is richer, the TranslatorBridge normalizes it first. Because concepts are regions that can learn from new examples and layers can be toggled quickly, expert systems built this way can evolve and be operated more rapidly than large monolithic rule sets.</p>

  <p>When you query, the engine assembles a runtime concept by applying the active layers. Deontic relations shift value axes to reflect permissions, obligations, or prohibitions. If layers conflict and the intersection of shapes is empty, the system stops and reports the collision instead of inventing an answer. You can also compare different stacks to see how outcomes change across doctrines; this is meta-rationality applied to rule systems.</p>

  <p>Outputs remain simple and auditable: True, Plausible, or False, with a trail that lists layers applied, dimensions that mattered, distances measured, and thresholds used. Every conclusion arrives with its “why,” making the system suitable for regulated or safety-critical domains where you must justify decisions and reproduce them later.</p>
