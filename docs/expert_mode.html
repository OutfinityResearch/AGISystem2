  <p>AGISystem2 is a modern take on the expert system. It replaces brittle IF/THEN chains with geometric regions and layered overrides. Rules become shapes; exceptions become overlays. This lets the system hold conflicting doctrines, choose the right one by context, and explain every decision.</p>

  <p>To build an expert, start with a base ontology and axiology. Then add domain theories as separate layers: civil law, war law, maritime rules, corporate policies, safety envelopes. Exceptions are new layers, not edits to the base. Precedence is explicit; the order of the stack determines which overrides apply. Facts and rules enter through the constrained grammar; if the source text is richer, the TranslatorBridge normalizes it first.</p>

  <p>When you query, the engine assembles a runtime concept by applying the active layers. Deontic relations shift value axes to reflect permissions, obligations, or prohibitions. If layers conflict and the intersection of shapes is empty, the system stops and reports the collision instead of inventing an answer. You can also compare different stacks to see how outcomes change across doctrines; this is meta-rationality applied to rule systems.</p>

  <p>Outputs remain simple and auditable: True, Plausible, or False, with a trail that lists layers applied, dimensions that mattered, distances measured, and thresholds used. Every conclusion arrives with its “why,” making the system suitable for regulated or safety-critical domains where you must justify decisions and reproduce them later.</p>
