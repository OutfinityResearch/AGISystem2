    <h1>Facts and Questions</h1>
  </div>
  <p>Facts and questions are the foundation of every interaction with AGISystem2. They are written as short, flat sentences in a constrained dialect: a subject, a relation, and an object. This chapter shows all the shapes that the engine accepts and gives concrete examples, with code blocks separated clearly from the surrounding explanations.</p>

  <h2>Facts: Subject REL Object</h2>
  <p>The simplest unit is a fact. A fact is a single line that states a subject–relation–object triple. The subject is usually a short identifier such as <code>Dog</code>, <code>Water</code>, <code>ProcedureX</code>, or <code>Alice</code>. The relation is an upper-case verb or verb phrase such as <code>IS_A</code>, <code>HAS_PROPERTY</code>, <code>REQUIRES</code>, <code>PROHIBITED_BY</code>, <code>PERMITTED_BY</code>, <code>CAUSES</code>, or <code>LOCATED_IN</code>. The object is everything that follows the relation on the same line; it may be a single token or a short phrase. The line does not end in a question mark.</p>

  <p>Basic typing and taxonomy facts:</p>
  <pre><code>Dog IS_A Animal
Water IS_A Substance
Alice IS_A Human</code></pre>

  <p>Property facts, where the object encodes an attribute or value:</p>
  <pre><code>Water HAS_PROPERTY boiling_point=100
Steel HAS_PROPERTY melting_point=1538C
Patient123 HAS_PROPERTY diagnosis=Hypertension</code></pre>

  <p>Deontic and regulatory facts, which assign permissions or prohibitions:</p>
  <pre><code>ExportData PROHIBITED_BY GDPR
ExportData PERMITTED_BY HIPAA
SurgeryX REQUIRES Consent
SurgeryX REQUIRES AuditTrail</code></pre>

  <p>Causal and temporal facts:</p>
  <pre><code>Fire CAUSES Smoke
Smoke CAUSED_BY Fire
Inspection BEFORE Shipment
Shipment AFTER Inspection</code></pre>

  <p>Spatial and narrative facts:</p>
  <pre><code>Alice LOCATED_IN CityX
CityX DISJOINT_WITH MagicZone
Alice CASTS Magic
SciFi_TechMagic PERMITS Magic_IN CityX</code></pre>

  <p>From the engine’s perspective these are all just triples, but the choice of relation name determines how reasoning modules interpret them. The Relations and Reasoning chapters describe those semantics; here the important point is that the syntax is always “Subject REL Object” on a single line.</p>

  <h2>Questions: Interrogatives and Canonical Triples</h2>
  <p>Questions reuse the same ingredients but appear as yes/no queries. There are two equivalent forms, both accepted by the engine.</p>

  <p>The first form is a simple English interrogative. It is normalised by the TranslatorBridge and parsed into an <code>IS_A</code> triple:</p>
  <pre><code>Is Dog an Animal?
Is Alice Human?
Is Water a Substance?</code></pre>

  <p>The second form is a canonical triple followed by a question mark. This works for any relation, not just <code>IS_A</code>:</p>
  <pre><code>Water HAS_PROPERTY boiling_point=100?
Alice LOCATED_IN CityX?
ExportData PROHIBITED_BY GDPR?
SurgeryX REQUIRES Consent?
Fire CAUSES Smoke?
Alice CASTS Magic?</code></pre>

  <p>In both forms the parser ends up with the same internal representation: a subject, a relation, and an object, plus a flag indicating that this is a query. The <code>ask</code> method on EngineAPI and the <code>ask</code> CLI command expect exactly these shapes.</p>

  <h2>Counterfactual Questions</h2>
  <p>Counterfactual queries look like ordinary questions paired with extra facts. The syntax for the question itself does not change; it is still an interrogative or a canonical triple with a question mark. The additional assumptions are written as normal fact lines and are passed separately.</p>

  <p>For example, in the CLI you might write:</p>
  <pre><code>cf Water HAS_PROPERTY boiling_point=50? | Water HAS_PROPERTY boiling_point=50</code></pre>

  <p>At API level the same idea appears as:</p>
  <pre><code>question   = "Water HAS_PROPERTY boiling_point=50?"
extraFacts = ["Water HAS_PROPERTY boiling_point=50"]</code></pre>

  <p>The key rule is that counterfactuals do not introduce new syntax: they reuse facts and questions exactly as described above. The engine never accepts nested formulas or free-form paragraphs; everything is expressed as flat triples or their interrogative counterparts.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Every fact that AGISystem2 stores and every question it answers is written as a single subject–relation–object triple or as a small English question that normalises to such a triple. If you keep this pattern in mind, all other syntactic features—such as theory files and macros—can be seen as ways of grouping or manipulating these triples rather than as separate languages.</p>
