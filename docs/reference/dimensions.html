  <p>The dimensional layout is the backbone of the system. We reserve 0–255 for ontology (facts and structure), 256–383 for axiology (values and norms), and 384+ for empirical/latent features learned from data. This fixed map holds across profiles so that masks, layers, and explanations remain stable.</p>

  <p>Ontology axes capture what something is: physical properties, biological status, legal identity, evidence strength, process structure, risk exposure, and more. Axiology axes capture how we judge it: moral valence, legality, permission, obligation, risk appetite, alignment with policies, and even emotional tone. Keeping these ranges disjoint lets us change value systems without altering facts and lets audits isolate where value judgments entered a decision.</p>

  <p>Beyond 383, dimensions are free-form. They arise from empirical learning and domain extensions. Relevance masks keep this tail sparse: for any given concept, only a small subset of axes is active. This keeps distances meaningful and explanations focused.</p>

  <p>For detailed catalogues of the fact and value axes, see <a href="ontology_dims.html">Ontology Dimensions</a> and <a href="axiology_dims.html">Axiology Dimensions</a>. For the empirical tail, the key practice is discipline: add only what you need, mask aggressively, and document any new axes you reserve so that future reasoning remains interpretable.</p>
