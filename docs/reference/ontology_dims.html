  <p>Ontological axes capture what something is in the world. They are factual, structural, and measurable, never evaluative. The first block of dimensions describes physical reality: mass, size, temperature, pressure, phase, motion, and stability. Another block encodes spatial and temporal anchoring—how specific a location is, how long an event lasts, how frequently it recurs, and where it sits in a sequence or concurrent flow. Biological and agency properties appear as flags and degrees for being living, having a taxonomy, possessing health and cognition, communicating, learning, remembering, and acting with purpose. Artifacts and systems carry signals about being a device, their power source, interfaces, computational and storage ability, autonomy, safety mechanisms, and reliability. Legal and entity-related axes track whether something is a legal person, which jurisdiction governs it, its contractual capacity, liability, registrations, and compliance class. Evidence and knowledge axes measure strength of evidence, source credibility, recency, consistency with theory, falsifiability, and provenance. Processes and control systems are described by inputs and outputs, control points, feedback, stability, resource constraints, failure modes, and observability or controllability. Risk and safety axes mark hazards, exposure, severity, likelihood, detectability, mitigation, and residual risk. Environmental and sustainability axes record impact, resource use, emissions, waste, and lifecycle footprint.</p>
  <p>The final slice of the ontology range, roughly 224–255, is left empty for domain-specific extensions. When you add an axis here, define its meaning precisely, its expected range, and how relevance masks should treat it. Update the catalog so that every new fact sets it explicitly; overloading existing axes erodes interpretability.</p>
  <p>These axes shape the box and center of each concept’s diamond. Theory layers may override them for counterfactual scenarios—such as altered physics—but such overrides are explicit and recorded. When BiasController masks axiology for audits, ontology remains intact so factual reasoning stays stable. A statement like “Water HAS_PROPERTY boiling_point=100” raises the temperature axis and tightens the mask around physical axes; a counterfactual layer can temporarily shift that bound without mutating the base concept.</p>
