    <h1>Syntax Overview</h1>
  </div>
  <p>AGISystem2 uses a deliberately small and explicit language for everything it ingests and reasons about. Instead of accepting arbitrary paragraphs, it expects short sentences that follow a constrained pattern. This keeps parsing transparent and makes later explanations easy to follow. The syntax is the same whether you talk to the engine through the API, the CLI, or files on disk.</p>
  <p>This overview page links to three focused chapters:</p>
  <p><strong><a href="syntax_facts_questions.html">Facts and Questions</a></strong> explains how to write assertions and yes/no queries in the canonical subject–relation–object style, with many concrete examples. It covers both simple triples and the interrogative forms used by <code>ask</code> and counterfactual queries.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="syntax_theories.html">Theory Files</a></strong> describes how to group facts into text files that represent theories, scenarios, or alternative worlds. It shows how theory files are structured, how comments and blank lines are treated, and how the CLI and API use them as temporary context layers.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="syntax_macros.html">Macros and the Theory DSL</a></strong> introduces the small domain-specific language used to define reusable reasoning patterns in text. It explains the <code>@var COMMAND ...</code> syntax, the built-in commands used by health, export, and narrative macros, and how you can override or extend these behaviours.</p>
  <p>All three chapters share the same underlying idea: every concept, rule, and macro can be traced back to a concrete line of text in this small language. The API and CLI chapters assume that you are familiar with these shapes and refer back to the syntax pages whenever they talk about “canonical grammar” or “theory DSL”.</p>
