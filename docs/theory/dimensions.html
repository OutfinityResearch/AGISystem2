    <h1>Dimensions Overview</h1>

  <p>The dimensional layout is the backbone of the system. We reserve 0–255 for ontology (facts and structure), 256–383 for axiology (values and norms), and 384+ for empirical/latent features learned from data. This fixed map holds across profiles so that masks, layers, and explanations remain stable and comparable over time.</p>

  <h2>Ontology (0–255)</h2>
  <p>Ontology axes capture what something is. In the default dimension catalogue, the 0–255 range is preconfigured into several thematic blocks, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical reality</strong> – physicality, solidity, mass/weight, size/scale, temperature (e.g., boiling point), pressure, density, phase, spatial extent.</li>
    <li><strong>Space and time</strong> – location specificity, temporality, duration, frequency, sequence position, recency, projections into the future.</li>
    <li><strong>Biology and agency</strong> – living flag, taxonomy anchor, health and metabolism, cognition and agency, communication, memory, learning, planning, sociality and roles.</li>
    <li><strong>Artifacts and systems</strong> – device flags, power source, interface type, computation and storage capability, autonomy, safety mechanisms, modularity, reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal and entity structure</strong> – legal entity flag, jurisdiction, contractual capacity, liability, registration, licenses, regulation class.</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence and knowledge</strong> – evidence strength, source credibility, recency, consistency with theory, falsifiability, uncertainty bands, provenance completeness.</li>
    <li><strong>Processes and control</strong> – process dynamics, inputs/outputs, control points, feedback, stability, resource constraints, failure modes, observability/controllability.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk and safety</strong> – hazard presence, exposure, severity, likelihood, detectability, mitigation, residual risk, safety margins, tolerance bands.</li>
    <li><strong>Environmental and governance</strong> – environmental impact, sustainability, resource consumption, emissions, waste, lifecycle footprint, supply chain and governance axes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These groups give every concept a rich factual backbone. Ontological dimensions are used when constructing diamonds, computing distances, and explaining which factual aspects supported or ruled out an answer.</p>

  <h2>Axiology (256–383)</h2>
  <p>Axiology axes capture how we judge things: moral valence, harm vs. beneficence, fairness, respect for autonomy, legality, permissibility, obligations, sanctions, risk appetite, preferences for safety, security, privacy, efficiency, transparency, alignment with policy/mission, and emotional tone (trust, fear, anger, joy, etc.). By keeping these dimensions in a dedicated partition, we can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>swap or layer different value systems without rewriting ontology,</li>
    <li>mask all value axes for veil-of-ignorance or bias audits,</li>
    <li>show clearly which axes carried value judgements in provenance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The detailed list of axiological axes is in the Axiology Dimensions page and in the dimension catalogue design spec.</p>

  <h2>Empirical Space (384+)</h2>
  <p>Beyond 383, dimensions form the empirical space. These axes are not pre-assigned in the core catalogue; they are reserved for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>latent features learned from data (for example, from embeddings or domain-specific statistics),</li>
    <li>deployment-specific extensions that do not fit cleanly into the ontology/axiology partitions,</li>
    <li>temporary or experimental axes used by research profiles.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Empirical axes start at index 384 and extend up to the configured dimension count (512, 1024, 2048, or 4096). Relevance masks keep this tail sparse: for any given concept, only a small subset of axes is active. This keeps distances meaningful and explanations focused, while allowing the space to grow as new domains are added.</p>

  <h2>Where to Go Next</h2>
  <p>For detailed catalogues of the fact and value axes, see <a href="ontology_dims.html">Ontology Dimensions</a> and <a href="axiology_dims.html">Axiology Dimensions</a>. For the empirical tail, the key practice is discipline: add only what you need, mask aggressively, and document any new axes you reserve so that future reasoning remains interpretable.</p>
  <p>For how these dimensions are populated during ingestion and learning, see the <a href="../usage-guide/ingestion.html">Data Ingestion</a> guide, and for the broader geometric context see the <a href="../wiki/conceptual_spaces.html">Conceptual Spaces</a>, <a href="../wiki/ontology.html">Ontology</a>, and <a href="../wiki/axiology.html">Axiology</a> wiki pages.</p>
