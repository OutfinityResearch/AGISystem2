    <h1>Axiology Dimensions (256–383)</h1>

  <p>Axiology axes encode judgments, norms, preferences, and emotional tones. They answer whether something is good or bad, permitted or forbidden, risky or safe, aligned or misaligned with policies or cultures. This range is reserved for values so that factual axes stay untouched when norms shift.</p>

  <h2>Preconfigured Axiology Blocks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Moral and legal valence</strong> – moral valence (good/bad), harmfulness vs. beneficence, fairness/justice, respect for autonomy and dignity, honesty, loyalty, care, responsibility, legality, permissibility, obligation weight, prohibition strength, sanction severity, enforcement likelihood, due process and precedent alignment.</li>
    <li><strong>Utility and efficiency</strong> – utility and efficiency value, profit/ROI orientation, cost sensitivity, resource and time efficiency, scalability and resilience values.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety and risk preferences</strong> – risk appetite, safety preference, security and privacy preferences, robustness and reliability preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency, trust and reputation</strong> – transparency and explainability preferences, trustworthiness expectations, reputation impact, accountability and liability assignment preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Alignment and governance</strong> – alignment with policy/mission, ideological, cultural, and brand alignment, stakeholder priority weights, sensitivity to bias and fairness (including protected classes and corrective fairness pressure), duties to disclose, permission to act, consent strength and revocability, remediation expectations, penalty tolerance.</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional and motivational tone</strong> – fear, anger, sadness, joy, disgust, surprise, empathy/compassion, hostility, trust/confidence, suspicion/doubt, attachment/aversion, curiosity/engagement, motivation/drive, risk aversion/ seeking, stress/anxiety.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Extensions</h2>
  <p>Dimensions 336–383 are left open for domain-specific value axes. When adding one, define its meaning, polarity, and the contexts in which it applies. Document typical ranges and masks, and resist the temptation to overload existing moral axes with unrelated values; clear separation preserves auditability.</p>

  <h2>Role in Reasoning, Bias Control and Explainability</h2>
  <p>Deontic relations (<code>PERMITS</code>, <code>PROHIBITS</code>, <code>OBLIGATES</code>) and theory layers act primarily on axiology. A war layer can neutralise prohibitions that a civil layer enforces, while BiasController can zero axiology for a veil-of-ignorance audit. When a layer changes axiology, the underlying ontology remains unchanged, so provenance can show exactly which value axes were touched.</p>
  <p>Keeping value dimensions explicit and separate allows you to swap or mask value systems deliberately. Provenance will always show which axiology axes influenced an outcome, making value-driven decisions transparent rather than hidden. For background on the philosophical and practical role of axiology, see the <a href="../wiki/axiology.html">Axiology</a>, <a href="../wiki/bias.html">Bias</a>, and <a href="../wiki/veil_of_ignorance.html">Veil of Ignorance</a> wiki pages, and for the partitioning into ontology vs. axiology see <a href="dimensions.html">Dimensions Overview</a>.</p>
