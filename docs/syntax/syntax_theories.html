    <h1>Syntax for Theory Files</h1>
  </div>
  <p>Theory files let you collect facts and Sys2DSL programmes into named bundles that can be applied as temporary overlays. They are plain text Sys2DSL scripts: each non-empty, non-comment line (or fragment of a line) is a statement of the form <code>@var ACTION ...</code>. This page shows how to structure those files, how they are used by sessions, and how to express both simple and more complex patterns, including references between newly defined variables via <code>$</code>.</p>

  <h2>Basic Structure</h2>
  <p>A theory file is a simple text file where each non-empty, non-comment line participates in a Sys2DSL script. Lines starting with <code>#</code> are comments and are ignored. Blank lines are also ignored. The engine does not interpret filenames; only the contents matter, but naming files after their purpose makes them easier to manage.</p>

  <p>Example: a minimal health‑compliance theory file <code>health_compliance.sys2dsl</code>:</p>
  <pre><code># Basic procedural requirements for ProcedureX
@_ ProcedureX ASSERT Consent
@_ ProcedureX ASSERT AuditTrail

@needs "ProcedureX REQUIRES ?" FACTS any
@given "? GIVEN yes" FACTS any
@present "? PRESENT yes" FACTS any
@allSat $given MERGE_LISTS $present
@decision $needs ALL_REQUIREMENTS_SATISFIED $allSat</code></pre>

  <p>Example: a small narrative theory file <code>scifi_magic.sys2dsl</code> that introduces a concept and immediately reuses it via variable references:</p>
  <pre><code># Baseline facts about Alice and CityX
@_ Alice ASSERT Human
@_ Alice ASSERT CityX
@_ Alice ASSERT Magic

@_ SciFi_TechMagic ASSERT CityX
@scenarioFacts $magic MERGE_LISTS $MagicTheory
@maskOntology ontology MASK_PARTITIONS any
@check Alice ASK Magic</code></pre>

  <p>There is no special syntax for “rules” beyond these Sys2DSL statements. What makes a file a theory is how the engine uses it: it reads all statements and treats their effects as additional context while answering questions or running validations, without permanent changes to long‑term memory unless you also ingest the same facts separately.</p>

  <h2>Topological Dependencies and <code>$</code> References</h2>
  <p>Theory files can express non-trivial dataflows by referencing variables that are defined later in the file. The Sys2DSL engine builds a dependency graph and evaluates statements in a topological order so that all <code>$name</code> references are resolved, as long as there are no cycles.</p>

  <p>Example: a theory file that defines a concept and immediately uses it in derived checks, independent of textual order:</p>
  <pre><code># Derived checks first
@_ Water ASSERT Celsius100
@_ Celsius100 ASSERT temperature
@waterPoint Water BIND_POINT any
@tempMask Temperature MASK_DIMS any
@checkBP Water ASK Celsius100

# Definition of reusable bundles below
@waterConcept Water BIND_CONCEPT any
@facts "Water BOILS_AT ?" FACTS any</code></pre>

  <p>Even though <code>@waterConcept</code> appears later in the file, any statement that uses <code>$waterConcept</code> will be executed after its definition. Circular references (for example <code>@a</code> depending on <code>$b</code> and <code>@b</code> on <code>$a</code>) are rejected with deterministic errors.</p>

  <h2>Using Theory Files via Sessions</h2>
  <p>At the API level, theory files are loaded as arrays of Sys2DSL lines and passed to a <code>System2Session</code>. The session hands them to the Sys2DSL engine, which executes the statements with topological evaluation and updates the session’s active theory. Separate commands control whether a session theory is persisted to disk or merged into an existing external theory file.</p>

  <h2>Organising Theories</h2>
  <p>You can keep theories small and focused, or use them as larger scenario descriptions:</p>
  <pre><code># Minimal theory per domain
health_core.sys2dsl
health_emergency_overrides.sys2dsl
export_eu_us.sys2dsl
narrative_magic_sci_fi.sys2dsl

# Scenario-based theories
scenario_hospital_A.sys2dsl
scenario_hospital_B.sys2dsl
scenario_cityX_festival.sys2dsl</code></pre>

  <p>AGISystem2 does not impose a particular naming or directory convention beyond what tooling might expect. It is up to you to decide whether a theory file represents a domain slice (for example, “EU export rules”) or a concrete situation (“the setup of hospital A on a given date”). In both cases, the syntax inside the file is the same: Sys2DSL statements <code>@var ACTION …</code>, possibly using <code>$</code> references and masks for more complex reasoning.</p>
