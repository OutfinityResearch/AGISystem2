# Future Improvements (Backlog)

This file is the single backlog for AGISystem2 “next work”.

### P4 — Research / feature expansion

#### T4.1 Semantic unification across theories (suggestion-first, no auto-merge) - - keep here, do not execute
- Alpha-equivalence signatures for graphs/rules (detect “same definition, different name”).
- Contextual fingerprints for operator/entity equivalence suggestions.
- Generate DSL proposals (`canonical` / `synonym`) for manual review (don’t auto-apply).
- Canonicalize “activation operator” patterns so macro vs manual composition converge.

#### T4.2 Operator upgrades (prioritized) - keep here, do not execute
- `analogy`: add an HDC relational algebra path (bind/unbind proportional reasoning).
- `abduce`: add Bayesian scoring (priors/likelihoods, evidence combination).
- `induce`: add statistical significance testing (chi-square / Fisher exact).
- `whatif`: extend beyond causal chains toward intervention semantics.
- `explain`: contrastive explanations + “why fail”.

#### T4.3 Constructivist Levels - keep here, do not execute
- Add level-indexed KB + level-segmented HDC bundles.
- Benchmark on large KBs (stress/saturation style) before committing to deeper integration.
